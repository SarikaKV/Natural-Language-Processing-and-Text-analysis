AESTHINT 59 - Nazi Cinema: The Art of Propaganda,AESTHINT 59 , Nazi Cinema: The Art of Propaganda,"Description:  As thinking beings we consider the limits of human potential and wonder what is the worst. The Nazis obsess us because they were masters of extremity who brought to the world unprecedented violence, destruction, and murder. They were also masters of propaganda who engineered sophisticated techniques of mass manipulation; in this endeavor cinema and modern media assumed a seminal role.

"AFRAMER 101 - The Color Line and Freedom Movements, in Geopolitical Context",AFRAMER 101 ," The Color Line and Freedom Movements, in Geopolitical Context","Description:  This seminar examines American racism and anti-racism, by situating this history in a deeply international context. We will seek thematic throughlines, from transnational abolitionism and Atlantic emancipations; to US imperialism in the Caribbean, amidst homefront Jim Crow; to the internationalist affinities of movements from Civil Rights to Black Lives. Throughout we will interpret how U.S. racial formations and contestations, have been consistently entangled with global war, empire, diaspora and solidarity -- from Civil War to World War, Cold War to Terror War. Our study will juxtapose scholarly, creative and primary sources -- to analyze together the American racial state's domestic and foreign policies, as well as the efforts of critical intellectuals and popular movements. We will touch on topics such as U.S. white-supremacist and anti-racist responses to Haitian self-determination, and African decolonization; African-American soldiers' wartime encounters with insurgent Mexico, WWII Europe, Vietnam and Iraq; efforts to link U.S. racial politics with comparable inequalities in the UK, Brazil, India, South Africa and Palestine; and consider worldviews expressed by leading strategists of U.S. foreign policy as well as those of artistic, religious, Pan-African, queer, Black feminist and labor activists across regions and over decades."
AFRAMER 101X - The Making and Breaking of Black Institutions,AFRAMER 101X , The Making and Breaking of Black Institutions,"Description:  This course explores the long history of institution building within the African American community. While black churches serve as the oldest black institutions in the United States, out of these organizations have emerged black secondary schools and colleges along with black businesses and print media. And, while black institutions were established in the crucible of racial segregation and overt racial animosity, these same institutions presently struggle for viability in a presumably ?post-racial? America. ?Race men? and ?race women? of the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries like Ida B. Wells, Mary McLeod Bethune, Booker T. Washington and Carter G. Woodson were conscious of the need to establish institutions for the advancement of black life while living under the stress of open white oppression. In this contemporary moment, however, we trace how multiple and changing formations of blackness are imprinted by issues like post-raciality, social mobility, and neoliberalism/racial capitalism manifest across different institutions. How do scholars interpret these changes and their influence on the ongoing economic and social stratification of black life in America? In exploring these issues we will read works of history, sociology and anthropology."

By examining the connections between race and the development of legal and penal systems over time, this course investigates the historical process that eventually gave rise to the mass incarceration of black and Latino Americans in the late twentieth century. The course is structured according to the major punitive changes that often emerged after the expansion of constitutional and civil rights for African Americans. Our historical consideration will provide us the necessary background to address the ongoing consequences of racial disparities in the criminal justice system and the momentous public policy implications of this dynamic."
AFRAMER 123Y - The Historical Philosophy of W.E.B. Du Bois,AFRAMER 123Y , The Historical Philosophy of W.E.B.

AFRAMER 131X - What could Scandal or How To Get Away with Murder possibly have in common with William Faulkner?,AFRAMER 131X , What could Scandal or How To Get Away with Murder possibly have in common with William Faulkner?,"Description:  This course puts our classic literature in conversation with current canonical pop culture. Specifically, each week we will examine how Shonda Rhimes?s hit television shows Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder resurrect the same charged topics of interracial sex, black personhood and white anxieties that William Faulkner described and imagined in his novels Absalom, Absalom and Light in August. All of these texts tackle themes such as othering, violence as liberation and the spectre of interracialism but what do they say about them in particular? What does Rhimes highlight about this? Faulkner? What is achieved textually versus visually? This course looks at how all of these expressions discuss the highly charged topic of race and blackness and offers a lense through which to look at our daily life. Goals of this course will be: Learning and refining the practice of close reading literature in order to pull away larger themes and arguments Learning and refining how to close read a visual performative text Practicing interdisciplinary thought and outlook"

These are the Breaks: The connection between vinyl from the 60?s, 70?s and 80?s and birth of what we now know as hip-hop music, is a connection that is known by producers, DJ?s and collectors of music, but not to academia. Various political, cultural, and social movements of the 1960?s created an environment for the stories of soul, jazz, and funk produced in the 1970?s, which in turn created the platform for our most treasured hip-hop albums (Illmatic, The BluePrint, The Chronic, College Dropout, The Minstrel Show). ""Diggers"" from around the world travel from country to country, from record shop to basement, in search of the original ""breaks"" used for these albums, in some cases for 10+ years.

ANE 103 - Ancient Lives,ANE 103 , Ancient Lives,"Description:  What are the essential elements of human society? Have our fundamental conditions developed, and how? Can we use themes from ancient history to think about contemporary society and culture? These questions are in focus in this course on 'Ancient Lives', which explores the earliest human civilizations in the region commonly known as Mesopotamia (c. 3000-300 bce) in what is now Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Few elements in the way we live and organize ourselves today are to be taken for granted. There is, and has always been, a wealth of ways in which humans live. But biologically we are the same as our ancestors of 5000 years ago, at the dawn of history. Any likeness or difference between 'us and them' is therefore likely to be a product of history and culture. 'Ancient Lives' builds upon this realization to inspire a critical way of thinking about society in the broadest possible scope. Areas explored during the course are selected for their relevance across the range of contemporary life - they include freedom, music, public health, food, jurisprudence, trade, the visual arts, science, sexuality, religion and political power. You learn about how societies and individuals have dealt with change on multiple levels, from large-scale societal revolutions to personal transformation. Having taken this course, you will have gained a fundamental understanding and appreciation of human life in the broadest scope, as well as of your own life as a part of history. You will be able to critically assess contemporary discourses on the study of 'the other' in past and present; engage with core concepts of human society, such as justice, beauty, value and belief on a broad historical base; be familiar with examples of classical social theory and thinkers through concrete cases in which their work has been applied to or shaped by the study of the past; and acquire skills in presenting scholarly work to a general audience."
ANE 132 - Ancient Jewish Wisdom Literature,ANE 132 , Ancient Jewish Wisdom Literature,"Description:  A close critical reading and interpretation of works thought to derive from the Wisdom tradition of ancient Israel, through the Second Temple period. The workings of the world and the ways of God as they appear in works such as Proverbs, Job, Qohelet, Ben Sira, some Psalms, the Wisdom of Solomon, Fourth Maccabees, and Pseudo-Phocylides as well as narratives about such figures as Joseph, Esther, and Daniel. Egyptian and Mesopotamian antecedents and parallels briefly considered. Emphasis on matters of worldview and literary form."
ANE 209 - Biographies in the Hebrew Bible,ANE 209 , Biographies in the Hebrew Bible,"Description:  The Hebrew Bible?s historiography is designed as a series of life stories. From Abraham to Isaac, from Jacob to Joseph, Moses, Joshua and on to the judges, prophets, and kings, this is a long-distance relay race in which the baton is being passed from one character to his successor, from the beginning of history till the expulsion of Israel from its Land. Some of these life stories, like Moses?s, are rather complete, starting with pre-birth traditions and ending with death; others, such as Joshua, are only partial.In this course, we will conduct a close reading of some of the Bible?s biographies, noting and explaining the relationships, similarities and differences between them. Since we deal with religious literature, special attention will also be given to each character?s relationship with God and its significance. All the while, we will question the biblical writers, their motivations, who they were supporting and who they were criticizing, what their ideological motivations were, and noticing and enjoying their literary techniques.Finally, we will also be looking at how some biographies came to be retold in Second Temple Period literature as well as rabbinic literature, and question the varying motives, literary tastes and modes of interpretation of the different eras and socio-political contexts."

ANTHRO 1010 - The Fundamentals of Archaeological Methods & Reasoning,ANTHRO 1010 , The Fundamentals of Archaeological Methods & Reasoning,"Description:  A comprehensive introduction to the practice of archaeology and major themes from our human past: how do archaeologists know where to dig? How do we analyze and understand what we find? What do we know about the origins of the human species, agriculture, cities, and civilization? The course integrates methods and theory, and utilizes Peabody Museum collections, to show how we reconstruct ancient diet, trade, and political systems. We also explore the role of archaeology in colonialism, modern politics, and film."
ANTHRO 1095 - Urban Revolutions: Archaeology and the Investigation of Early States,ANTHRO 1095 , Urban Revolutions: Archaeology and the Investigation of Early States,"Description:  Examines the development and structure of the earliest state-level societies in the ancient world. Archaeological approaches are used to analyze the major factors behind the processes of urbanization and state formation in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Central Asia, the Indus Valley, and Mesoamerica. The environmental background as well as the social, political, and economic characteristics of each civilization are compared to understand the varied forces that were involved in the transitions from village to urbanized life. Discussion sections utilize archaeological materials from the Peabody Museum and Semitic Museum collections to study the archaeological methods used in the class."
ANTHRO 1130 - Archaeology of Harvard Yard,ANTHRO 1130 , Archaeology of Harvard Yard,"Description:  Archaeological data recovered from Harvard Yard provide a richer and more nuanced view of the 17th through 19th century lives of students and faculty in Harvard Yard, an area that includes the Old College and Harvard Indian College. Students will excavate in Harvard Yard, process and analyze artifacts, and report on the results. Additional topics to be covered include regional historical archaeology, research design, surveying, archival research, stratigraphy, and artifact analysis."
"ANTHRO 1250 - The Pyramids of Giza: Technology, Archaeology, History",ANTHRO 1250 ," The Pyramids of Giza: Technology, Archaeology, History","Description:  Focuses on the Pyramids, Sphinx, and tombs at Giza (ca. 2500 BC), in the context of ancient Egyptian history, art, and archaeology. The HU-MFA Expedition excavated Giza, resulting in today's Giza Project at Harvard. Seminar takes place in Harvard's Visualization Center with 3D viewing of the Giza Necropolis on a 23-foot screen, and consists of introductory lectures, student presentations, and field trips. Topics range from challenges of archaeological information processing to Old Kingdom mortuary art and architecture, to issues of ownership and repatriation. Students will also contribute to the (real world) Giza Project at Harvard."
ANTHRO 1604 - The Anthropology of Law,ANTHRO 1604 , The Anthropology of Law,"Description:  This course has two principal goals: The first is to introduce students to the key issues, concepts, and methods of the anthropology of law as a distinct field of research. This part of the course in the first several weeks covers the intellectual history of legal anthropology, outlining the legacy of the most influential approaches to the comparative and ethnographic study of legal systems. Second, the anthropology of law will be approached as a sub-discipline with important things to say about contemporary cultural contests, activism, group representation, and identity formation. It has emerged in the past decade or so as a particularly ground breaking field of research, in part because it has become central to understanding the changed dynamics of cultural expression and collective identity through new avenues of communication and transnational networking. In many parts of the world, legal systems are ?pluralizing,? often integrating local conceptions of justice with formal procedures and institutions. At the same time, more people and organizations than ever before are using the institutions and mechanisms of law to achieve conditions of equal access to the benefits of rights, recognition, and prosperity, above all through new standards and processes of human rights and environmental justice."
ANTHRO 1610 - Ethnographic Research Methods,ANTHRO 1610 , Ethnographic Research Methods,"Description:  Introduction to methodology for contemporary ethnographic field research in anthropology. Students complete assigned and independent research projects relying on a variety of ethnographic methods, under supervision of department faculty."
ANTHRO 1661 - (Mis)Understanding Islam Today,ANTHRO 1661 , (Mis)Understanding Islam Today,"Description:  This course grapples with key controversies ? suicide bombings, blasphemy, gender, Muslim minorities, Islamism ? as a point of entry into understanding Muslim cultures and societies. Drawing on insights from Cultural Anthropology and related fields (Religious Studies, History, Government, Philosophy, Law), the course also encourages self-reflection on our own assumptions regarding religion, secularism, freedom, tolerance and violence. Finally, by dwelling on the case of cross-cultural (mis)understandings related to Islam, the course underscores that no matter what our personal objectives ? social theorizing, developing policy, or being an engaged global citizen ? there is value in understanding how historical and cultural contexts shape us all. No prior familiarity with Islam is required or assumed."
ANTHRO 1683 - The City Jail: Race and Incarceration in the United States,ANTHRO 1683 , The City Jail: Race and Incarceration in the United States,"Description:  This course will investigate the conditions of mass incarceration in America through the figure of the municipal jail (which sees on average twelve million admissions annually). We will begin with the question ?What is a jail?? and move from there to interrogate the cultural, economic, political and legal forces that shape the conditions of possibility for the 21st century jail. Taking as objects of study both the jail itself and the practice of incarcerating people in local jails, this course will combine scholarly work on U.S. criminal justice with a variety of non-academic texts including legal decisions, contemporary journalism, and documentary film. Over the course of the semester students will learn to ?locate? the city jail in a number of different ways: within the complex political and economic structures of the American municipality, within the criminal justice system writ large, and within the country?s long history of anti-black racism and struggles for freedom. Students will use the jail itself as a conceptual anchor from which to question the taken-for-granted terms of American practices of captivity"
ANTHRO 1732 - China Through Ethnography and Film: Problems of Science and Sex,ANTHRO 1732 , China Through Ethnography and Film: Problems of Science and Sex,"Description:  The rapid rise of China on the global stage is one of the most important developments of our time. Under the slogan ?reform and opening up,? an ambitious party-state has sought to remake the economy and society so as to propel the nation to global prominence and power. The key instrument for societal transformation has been modern science and technology; a key target has been the biological, sexed body. Drawing on recent ethnographic texts and some independent documentary films, this course explores the dynamics, contradictions, and effects of governance through science and sex. Focusing on four domains of life perceived as broken or still ?backward? ? the mind, gender and sexuality, health, and the environment ? it asks: With China?s entry into global economic, social, and scientific circuits, who is governing China?s society, through what logics and techniques, and with what effects? What is happening to the party-state in an age of market ascendance? What is science in the Chinese context; who is making it and with what effects? How are China?s people responding to transformations in state and market dynamics in their efforts to create lives worth living?"
ANTHRO 1800 - Race and Caste,ANTHRO 1800 , Race and Caste,"Description:  Race and caste are two of the most enduring forms of social stratification. While their histories date well before the advent of political democracy, they have taken on new forms in the context of democratic social transformation and capitalist development. In this course, we will grapple with the meanings, uses, and politics of race and caste historically and in the contemporary moment. Drawing on mid-20th century sociological debates on race and caste as comparative categories, empirical work in history and anthropology that traces the legacies of imperialism and capitalism in shaping race and caste, and insights from anti-racist and anti-caste social movements, this course considers the intersections of (and divergences between) the two forms of stratification. What does thinking race and caste together illuminate about the nature of ascriptive identity and inequality today?"
"ANTHRO 1876 - Society, Culture, and Modernity in Greece",ANTHRO 1876 ," Society, Culture, and Modernity in Greece","Description:  Greece today is a country of revealing paradoxes: touted as the home of modern European philosophical and political (?democratic?) culture yet often relegated to the margins of European geo-politics, Greece has in recent years been known more for its economic crisis than for its cultural contributions. Yet the country continues to serve as a symbol of those institutions ? notably the European Union ? that treat it with the least respect. What are the reasons behind this paradox? What can a careful reading of the state of culture in Greece today tell us about the country?s ?real? history and about its wider significance? Answering such questions via a ?quick and dirty? shortcut offers no real answers at all. To understand the situation of modern Greece requires a careful assessment of its traditional culture and values, its beholden (?crypto-colonial?) relationship to the Western powers (including the dominant members of the E.U. as well as the United States), and the complex intersection of gender, politics, and social attitudes (including those prevalent in communities regarded as lawless by the Greek state, from social bandits to student rebels). In this course, therefore, we will explore the Greek enigma ?from the bottom up??from the perspective of unarguably ?traditional? rural societies to the crisis-ridden modern nation-state as experienced by a wide range of its citizens. Much journalistic coverage of the crisis is informed by a remarkable ignorance of, and inattention to, the values and concepts that have shaped present-day Greek attitudes over many centuries. A great deal of the media coverage from within Greece represents the perspectives of particular ideologies and parties. We will devote some time to considering how the representations of responsibility and obligation affect the way the present crisis is playing out."
ANTHRO 1882 - The Woman and the Body,ANTHRO 1882 , The Woman and the Body,"Description:  This course probes the making of the gendered/sexed/raced/classed body in America today. Focusing on the rise of the ?obesity epidemic,? it traces the scientific, political, and cultural controversies engendered by the rapid increase in childhood and adult obesity since the 1970s. Through close study of key debates ? Do diets work? Can fat be healthy? Who can be a good biocitizen? What made us fat? What is the solution?, and others ? the course explores how individual selves and social differences are being reconstituted by larger transformations in the sciences, technologies, bio-politics, and bio-economies of life. Lying at the intersection of the anthropology of the body, science studies, medical anthropology, and gender/sexuality studies, the course outlines an important new arena for critical inquiry."
"ANTHRO 1988 - Kinship, Citizenship, and Belonging",ANTHRO 1988 ," Kinship, Citizenship, and Belonging","Description:  The domains of family life, kinship, and intimacy represent central sites for the construction and contestation of social and political belonging. This course introduces students to classic and contemporary theories of society, kinship, and citizenship by way of theorizing how economic production, sovereignty, and everyday life emerge through the regulation of relatedness. Anthropologists of the late nineteenth century and of the first half of the twentieth century turned kinship into a key domain for understanding social cohesion and political organization. In the past three decades -- following feminist, Marxist, and queer critiques -- anthropologists explored how discourses about kinship and the family anchored the ideologies and practices of modernity, colonialism, nationalism, and globalization. In this course, we ask: What can various forms of kinship teach us about the politics of social reproduction and the making of citizenship -- its modes of belonging and exclusion -- in the contemporary world?"
ANTHRO 2000 - Osteoarchaeology Lab,ANTHRO 2000 , Osteoarchaeology Lab,"Description:  Introduction to the osteoarchaeological analysis.

Focuses on the archaeology of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, the Andes, and the Pacific coast of Peru and Chile. Extensive use will be made of the South American collections in the Peabody Museum."
ANTHRO 2250A - Proseminar in Archaeology,ANTHRO 2250A , Proseminar in Archaeology,"Description:  This graduate seminar reviews critical issues in archaeological approaches to small-scale societies, including methods and interpretations relating to the study of mobility, sedentism, seasonality, plant and animal exploitation, and migration."
ANTHRO 2640 - Crypto-Colonialism,ANTHRO 2640 , Crypto,"Description:  This course examines the spread of colonialism beyond the acknowledged borders. Starting from the examples of Thailand and Greece, and extending the analysis to a wide array of other countries (e.g. Nepal, Iran, Afghanistan, and Iceland), the course examines the the creation of national cultures as a means of external political control, and inspects the consequences in both geopolitical and ethnographic terms."
ANTHRO 2650A - History and Theory of Social Anthropology: Proseminar,ANTHRO 2650A , History and Theory of Social Anthropology: Proseminar,Description:  A critical review of the major theoretical approaches in social anthropology.
ANTHRO 2722 - Sonic Ethnography,ANTHRO 2722 , Sonic Ethnography,"Description:  This is a practice-based course in which students record, edit, and produce anthropologically informed audio works which interpret culture and lived experience. Listening sessions will provide a broad context of contemporary work using location recordings, and readings will situate the practice within the growing field of sound studies. In their projects, students will experiment with technical and conceptual strategies of recording and composition as they engage with questions of ethnographic representation through the sensory dimension of sound."
ANTHRO 2744 - Madness and Globalization,ANTHRO 2744 , Madness and Globalization,"Description:  While the term `mental illness? evokes aseptic technical categories and medical nosologies, `madness,? in its deliberate murkiness, embraces broader and deeper meanings, including `post-colonial disorders? of individuals and societies. This course will analyze the ways in which diverse aspects of globalization impact, intersect and shape personal experiences of `madness? ? both mental illnesses and social disorders. Largely based on readings of ethnographic and cross-cultural literature, the course will examine, among other issues: the process of colonization, which racialized psychiatric interpretations of the individual?s behavior and suffering; colonial and postcolonial engagements with psychoanalysis; the postcolonial standardization of nosologies and treatments, based mostly on biomedical categories, and the complex negotiations of the meanings of modernity; the resulting cases of `globalization? of approaches to mental health/illness in non-Western contexts; the attempt at the decolonization of anthropology and psychiatry alike; the impact of violence, forced migration and displacement on the the psychological equilibrium and mental health of individuals, and the globalization of PTSD; and the impact of neoliberal economic policies and ideologies, as well as the global mental health movement, on the world of the mentally ill."
"ANTHRO 2800 - Social Theory, In and Out of Africa",ANTHRO 2800 ," Social Theory, In and Out of Africa","Description:  Examines, in critical depth, the major theoretical and methodological approaches that have shaped the history of Anglo-American anthropology and, more generally, social thought through the prism of Africa. In so doing, it will address (i) the historical roots and philosophical foundations of these approaches and (ii) their significance for contemporary concerns in the social sciences at large."

ANTHRO 98A - Junior Tutorial in Anthropology,ANTHRO 98A , Junior Tutorial in Anthropology,"Description:  This course is focused on preparing students to do anthropological fieldwork and develop their own research projects. Through concrete case studies and practical exercises students will be introduced to different approaches to developing research problems, conducting research, and ethnographic writing. Topics covered will include defining research questions and objects of study, situating projects within scholarly literature, and bringing together research data and analysis in different forms of anthropological writing.The aim of the course is not an exhaustive overview of research design but to familiarize students with some of the key practices and concerns of anthropological research and writing. The course seeks to guide students in reading anthropological texts, understanding the range of data and its representations, unpacking the analytical moves being made in the text, and thinking through the implications of such presentation.The course is divided into two main components. The first focuses on a case study of a developing anthropological work by the instructor. Through select readings related to their topic of interest and original research documents (proposals, fieldnotes, media, news reports, photographs, analytical essays, among others) students will learn the process of turning a research question into an anthropological project. The case study is also meant to prepare students for the experience of conducting their own research and serve as an example of how to transform research findings into anthropological writing.Simultaneously, this course is also a research practicum in which students will apply what they have learned to design their own anthropological projects and share with each other research goals, experiences, and components of their emerging work. Through structured assignments, seminar workshops, and regular individual meetings with their instructor students will produce an original research essay based on their research over the course of the semester."

In addition, the theory and research evidence accumulating in the disciplines of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and from STEM classrooms, has turned the question of, 'How do we best teach science?' into its own scientific discipline. The Theory and Science of Teaching focuses on understanding why certain teaching methods are effective by examining the scientific research and theoretical frameworks that support these methods. We will read and discuss foundational educational and cognitive psychology texts and primary literature, and then develop an annotated lesson plans that allows us to put these ideas into practice."

CELTIC 103 - The Celts,CELTIC 103 , The Celts,"Description:  This course examines the ways that an elusive population group called ""The Celts"" has been constructed from antiquity to the present. We study the linguistic, archaeological, genetic, mythological, literary and institutional bases of ""Celticity"" in the light of recent critiques of the ways in which these different kinds of evidence have been asked to walk hand in hand with one another in the service of certainty about Celtic identity. All texts are read in translation."
CELTIC 106 - The Folklore of Gaelic Scotland,CELTIC 106 , The Folklore of Gaelic Scotland,"Description:  An introduction to the traditional stories, lore, customs, and music of Gaelic Scotland and Nova Scotia. Scottish Gaelic folklore exploded onto the world stage in the 1760s with the publication of Macpherson?s 'Ossianic' epics, which he alleged to have translated from Gaelic originals. The ensuing controversy motivated scholars to seek out and record Gaelic folklore. The treasure trove they discovered has amazed those interested in traditional cultures ever since. This course introduces prominent collectors, tradition bearers, and their traditions. Issues of collecting are considered, and theoretical approaches are explored to gain a deeper understanding of the material. All texts are available in English translation."
CELTIC 109 - Finn: The Great Gaelic Hero,CELTIC 109 , Finn: The Great Gaelic Hero,"Description:  This course explores the lengthy and wildly popular Irish and Scottish Gaelic tradition surrounding the hero, Finn mac Cumaill (a.k.a. 'Finn MacCool' or 'Fionn mac Cumhaill'). Finn is variously portrayed as a hunter-warrior-seer and is the leader of the intrepid fiana war band. We survey this Fenian literature as it is presented to us by medieval and early modern Gaelic manuscript tradition. We also engage with the rich modern Fenian folklore of Ireland, Scotland, and Nova Scotia. This includes the study of important texts such as Acallam na Senorach `The Dialogue of the Ancients? and Toraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghrainne `The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Grainne?. Additionally, we consider the international impact of the Fenian tradition by examining James Macpherson's infamous, eighteenth-century, English-language adaptations and the ensuing Ossian controversy. All Gaelic texts are read in English translation."
CELTIC 111 - Shapeshifters and Manbeasts in Celtic Traditions,CELTIC 111 , Shapeshifters and Manbeasts in Celtic Traditions,"Description:  In Irish, Welsh, Scottish and Breton narratives, humans turn into other kinds of animal (and animals into humans) for many different reasons?as punishment, as escape, as expression of their inner nature, among others. These stories are written into medieval manuscripts, recorded from oral storytellers in the twentieth century, recounted in contemporary film, and embedded in popular music. Is there a stable boundary between the animal and human worlds? We explore shapeshifting stories in all of these modes and media, reading them against a background of texts about animals and humans from their own times and ours. All of our readings are in English or English translation: no knowledge of a Celtic language is required."
CELTIC 121 - The Art of Storytelling in Medieval Ireland,CELTIC 121 , The Art of Storytelling in Medieval Ireland,"Description:  An exploration of what we know about storytelling and storytellers in Ireland of the Middle Ages. Also to be considered are: notions of narrative genres; the hero as storyteller, the storyteller as hero; the interface among native Irish, Classical, and biblical notions and repertoires of story; the ""visuals"" of story; stories as linked together in cycles, or as ""prequels"" and ""sequels."" Readings will be in English/translation. No previous knowledge of Irish or Celtic tradition required."

COMPLIT 179 - Ghostwriters and Ventriloquists: Postwar Jewish American Culture,COMPLIT 179 , Ghostwriters and Ventriloquists: Postwar Jewish American Culture,"Description:  This course takes ideas of the ""ghostwriter"" and the ""ventriloquist"" as a lens through which to read postwar Jewish American culture. In the wake of the Holocaust, Jewish American writers and cultural producers began to feel a responsibility to a lost civilization that seemed to haunt their every creative act. Even as they achieved worldwide fame, these artists felt both burdened and inspired by old world ghosts. Often the very success of a given work was attributed to the ways in which it reanimated and revoiced ghosts in order to alternately dazzle and comfort audiences. This course asks: How do strategies of ghostwriting and ventriloquy compensate for trauma and loss? In what ways do such reenactments modify an original text? Through analysis of postwar texts and films in English and Yiddish (in translation), this course studies how specters of the past function both as arbiters of cultural value and as reminders of the discontinuities and traumas of the Jewish American present. Films include Tevya, Fiddler on the Roof, The Diary of Anne Frank, and the TV series Transparent. We will read texts by Sholem Aleichem, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Philip Roth, Cynthia Ozick, Grace Paley, and others."

These isotope systems are driven by basic physical chemical principles that if understood, allow even more to be drawn from core isotopic systems (namely the biogeochemical elements ? C, H, N, O, S). Further, advances in mass spectrometry now allow for site-specific isotopic determinations, as well as the quantification of trace isotope bonding (clumping). This course will begin with a quick but rigorous review of the chemistry underpinning equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects, before moving to survey the systematics that govern the most popular low temperature isotope systems. From there, the bulk of the course will target new and emerging isotopic targets such as clumping in O2 and methane."

ECON 1036 - The Psychology and Economics of Beliefs,ECON 1036 , The Psychology and Economics of Beliefs,"Description:  This seminar focuses on how individuals and groups come to form beliefs about important things in their lives. What medicines are effective? What lifestyles are healthy? What investment strategies make sense? What careers are lucrative and rewarding? What economic systems produce more growth or income equality? We will review theories and evidence about how individuals develop their beliefs from personal observations, experience, and by learning from others. The organizing theme will be to compare the assumption of full rationality that is traditional in economic theory to evidence identified by psychologists and others about errors people make. We will also explore what consequences these errors have. When do people become overconfident or underconfident that they know the right answer? Are people's beliefs internally consistent? When do groups of people all come to the same conclusions, vs. ""polarize"" into very different beliefs? Because of the heavy emphasis on rigorous formal theories and measurements along the lines of mainstream economics, the course requires background in microeconomics, mathematics, and statistics. Required readings for the course will include academic research in psychology, economic theory, empirical economics, and historical and sociological research describing the prevalence and changes in beliefs over time. The course will require attendance and participation in discussions and presentations, problems sets, and a research-oriented written assignment."
ECON 1057 - Game Theory with Applications to Social Behavior,ECON 1057 , Game Theory with Applications to Social Behavior,"Description:  Game theory is the formal toolkit for analyzing situations in which payoffs depend not only on your actions (say, which TV series you watch), but also others' (whether your friends are watching the same show). You've probably already heard of some famous games, like the prisoners' dilemma and the costly signaling game. We'll teach you to solve games like these, and more, using tools like Nash equilibrium, subgame perfection, Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and the one-shot deviation principle.Game theory has traditionally been applied to understand the behavior of highly deliberate agents, like heads of state, firms in an oligopoly, or participants in an auction. However, we'll apply game theory to social behavior typically considered the realm of psychologists and philosophers, such as why we speak indirectly, in what sense beauty is socially constructed, and where our moral intuitions come from.Each week, students are expected to complete a problem set, to read 2-3 academic papers, and to complete a 1-2 page response to short essay questions (`prompts') on these readings. All assignments can be completed in groups of two. Tutorials are not required but are highly recommended for students without a substantial background, especially in math. There will also be a final exam."
ECON 1080 - Great Theorems of Microeconomic Theory,ECON 1080 , Great Theorems of Microeconomic Theory,"Description:  This course surveys the most important results in microeconomics that have shaped the field in the years since WWII. It has two objectives: (i) To understand how the questions were posed, who the innovative researchers were, and what external influences drove them to approach the subject as they did. This ? of the course is the modern history of micro-economic thought. (ii) The major results themselves. This ? of the course is quite technical. The lectures will explain and introduce these results in their historical context, and provide the mathematical background. Class participants will present proofs of the results in section.The major theorems covered come from choice theory under certainty and uncertainty, general equilibrium theory, non-cooperative game theory, cooperative game theory, social choice, and the economics of incentives and mechanism design.Course requirements comprise three papers and one end-of-term take home exam. Section presentations will also be a component of the grade."
"ECON 1083 - Growth, Inequality, and the Income of Households",ECON 1083 ," Growth, Inequality, and the Income of Households","Description:  Since the 1970s households in the United States and other advanced economies have seen their income growth slow as a result of slower overall economic growth and rising inequality?compounded in many countries by men withdrawing from the workforce. In China and many emerging economies, households have seen substantial income gains?as fast overall economic growth has outweighed the rise in inequality. This course will analyze the ways in which growth, inequality and labor force participation shape the incomes of typical households, focusing on the United States, other advanced economies, and to a lesser degree developing economies. The course will consider the causes of the changes in growth and inequality a well as their relationship?asking questions like whether higher growth inevitably entails higher inequality and whether inequality can be bad for growth. In addition, we will consider the positive and normative evaluation of policies that entail tradeoffs between growth and inequality.This course forms a unified sequence with SUP-206 ?The Causes and Consequences of Inequality? taught in the spring which provides a more microeconomic and focused perspective on inequality. While either course can be taken separately, taking them together as a sequence is recommended for students wanting to pursue a more in depth study of household incomes and inequality."

ECON 1450 - The Political Economy of Religion,ECON 1450 , The Political Economy of Religion,"Description:  The study of the political economy of religion is grounded in two intellectual strands of thought developed in economics and sociology. The economic approach views religious competition and church-state relations as market phenomena. The absence of state religion allows for competition, thereby creating an environment for a plurality of religious faiths in society.The continual subdividing of religion into sects ensures an open and competitive market whereby no one single religion dominates.The sociological approach focuses on religious beliefs and activities as rational choices as well as cultural phenomena.Religious beliefs are a part of cultural traits, values, and organizations which contribute to economic outcomes. As in commercial activity, people respond to religious costs and benefits in a predictable, observable manner. Religious beliefs that promote hard work, thrift, and honesty can be found across the world?s major religions. The key question is: How does a society promote these values and in what circumstances does it, intentionally or unintentionally, discard them? People choose a religion (the theory of sects) and the degree to which they participate and believe (if at all). In this course we discuss a wide range of topics--religious competition, secularization (and its varieties), pluralism and tolerance, the structure of religious organizations, religion and individual behavior?that highlight the contributions and areas of further research in the field of political economy of religion."

ECON 1490 - The World Economy: Growth or Stagnation?,ECON 1490 , The World Economy: Growth or Stagnation?,"Description:  The world economy is gradually recovering from the financial and economic crisis that originated in the United States in 2007-2009. Despite the slow recovery of Europe and the U.S., world economic growth has continued at an accelerated pace since the mid-1990s. This is due to very rapid growth of Asian economies, especially China and, increasingly, India. China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest economy in 2014, while India surpassed Japan in 2012, becoming the world's third largest economy. The growth of the two Asian economic giants is rapidly transforming the world economy. The ultimate objective of Economics 1490 is to assess the prospects for sustainable growth of the world economy in the future. Will slower growth of the U.S., Japan, and the leading economies of Europe lead to worldwide stagnation or will the accelerated growth of the world economy continue?"

ECON 1936 - Keynes,ECON 1936 , Keynes,"Description:  This course explores the birth, death, and resurrection of The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money from the Great Depression (1929-1939) to the Great Recession (2008-?). A major goal is to lay out a coherent argument that, for all its theoretical innovation, The General Theory did not deliver: the argument why a market system, even an idealized system with all of the warts removed, may fail to provide jobs for willing workers. In the process we will examine the orthodoxy that Keynes attacked and that resurfaced in the 1960s and 70s; the key concepts underlying the models implicit in The General Theory; and the attempts of the Keynesian mainstream to make peace with both Keynes and orthodoxy. We will also explore the applicability of The General Theory to the long run. A final section will view the present economic difficulties through a Keynesian lens."

ECON 2035 - Psychology and Economic Theory,ECON 2035 , Psychology and Economic Theory,"Description:  This course explores ways that psychological research indicating systematic departures from classical economic assumptions can be translated into formal models that can be incorporated into economics. Topics include ways utility theory can be improved--such as incorporating reference dependence, news utility, social preferences, self image, and other belief-based tastes--and ways we can relax assumptions of perfect rationality--such as incorporating focusing effects, limited attention, biased prediction of future tastes, present-biased preferences, biases in probabilistic judgment, and errors in social inference. The course will emphasize (a) careful interpretation and production of new evidence on relevant departures,(b) formalizing this evidence into models that can, with discipline and rigor, generate sharp predictions using traditional economic approaches, and (c) exploring economic implications of those models presented. Although we will primarily emphasize (b), the course is meant to be useful to students whose interests lie anywhere in this spectrum, under the premise that all such research will be improved by a greater appreciation of the full spectrum. The course is intended for PhD students in the Business Economics and Economics programs and others who have a solid background in microeconomic theory at the level of introductory PhD courses in these programs. While obviously appropriate to those wishing to specialize in ""behavioral economics"", the course is also designed for those interested in doing research in particular fields of economics. And while the course centers on theoretical models (learning and evaluation will center around solving formal problem sets), the theory is focused towards its empirical implementability and economic relevance, so that the course is also designed for those interested in theory-influenced empirical research."
ECON 2040 - Experimental Economics,ECON 2040 , Experimental Economics,"Description:  This course provides an introduction to experimental methods and their applications in economics. We will focus on (i) the use of lab experiments in establishing causal effects, testing models, and illuminating mechanisms and (ii) the measurement of preference parameters and behavioral traits in lab-in-the-field settings. We will illustrate both methods through papers in behavioral, cultural and development economics. Topics include bounded rationality in belief formation and choice, motivated reasoning, moral wiggling, gender, the social or historical determinants of preferences, and the explanatory power of behavioral traits for field behaviors. We will cover methodological topics including the relationship between experiments and theory, cross-cultural experiments, internet experiments, and surveys. Students will become acquainted with the process of designing an experiment, and class discussions will place heavy emphasis on the development of early-stage research ideas. The course is intended not just for those with an interest in behavioral and experimental economics per se, but also for those who wish to measure behavioral parameters in non-lab settings."
ECON 2059 - Decision Theory,ECON 2059 , Decision Theory,"Description:  This course prepares students for pure and applied research in axiomatic decision theory. We start with a rigorous treatment of the classical topics that are at the heart of all of economics (utility maximization, expected utility, discounted utility, Bayesian updating, dynamic consistency, option value). We then delve into a number of modern topics inspired by the observed violations of the classical models (""exotic preferences"" used in macro-finance, ambiguity aversion, temptation and self-control). The last part of the course explores the recently flourishing literature on stochastic choice (which is related to, but distinct from, discrete choice econometrics). Prerequisites: basic microeconomic theory at the level of Mas Colell, Whinston, Green; being comfortable with abstract models."

ENGLISH 181A - Introduction to Asian American Literature: What Is Asian American Literature?,ENGLISH 181A , Introduction to Asian American Literature: What Is Asian American Literature?,"Description:  Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers (1974) was one of the earliest attempts to collect writings that were, to quote the editors, ?exclusively Asian-American.? Yet as their lengthy?and controversial?explanation of the selection process makes clear, Asian American literature defies neat categorization. This course is both a survey of Asian American literature and an introduction to ongoing debates about what constitutes Asian American literature. We will study a variety of literary genres and ask how formal and stylistic conventions, as well as shifting sociohistorical circumstances, have shaped conceptions of Asian American literature."
ENGLISH 185E - The Essay: History and Practice,ENGLISH 185E , The Essay: History and Practice,"Description:  Matthew Arnold famously said that poetry is, at bottom, ?a criticism of life.? But if any literary form is truly a criticism of life, it is the essay. And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: ?non-fiction.? At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, diary, criticism, and sometimes all four at once. Novels are becoming more essayistic, while essays are borrowing conventions and prestige from fiction. This class will disinter the essay from its comparative academic neglect, and examine the vibrant contemporary borderland between the reported and the invented. We will study the history of the essay, from Montaigne to the present day. Rather than study that history purely chronologically, each class will group several essays from different decades and centuries around common themes: death, detail, sentiment, race, gender, photography, the city, witness, and so on. In addition to writing about essays ? writing critical essays about essays ? students will also be encouraged to write their own creative essays: we will study the history of the form, and practice the form itself. Essayists likely to be studied: Plutarch, Montaigne, Hazlitt, De Quincey, Woolf, Benjamin, Orwell, Camus, Primo Levi, Barthes, Baldwin, Sontag, Dyer, Didion, Leslie Jamison, Knausgaard, Ta-Nehisi Coates."

ENGLISH 42 - Arrivals: British Literature 700-1700,ENGLISH 42 , Arrivals: British Literature 700,"Description:  A study of central genres of Old English, Middle English, and Early Modern literature in tandem with the development of ideas of nation and community, with a special emphasis on poetic narratives. Key texts include Beowulf, The Canterbury Tales, The Faerie Queene, Paradise Lost, and The Pilgrim's Progress."
ENGLISH 45 - Arrivals: British Literature 700-1700,ENGLISH 45 , Arrivals: British Literature 700,"Description:  In this course we will read some of the most significant and influential works of literature written in England before 1700. We will encounter the genres, tropes, forms, and language of medieval and early modern English literature, while exploring how these texts respond to and shape issues of their time, including war, political regimes, the emergence of national, racial, and religious identities, and changing attitudes to gender and sexuality. We will also develop a foundational range of critical writing skills and methods for approaching English literature."
"ENGLISH 50 - Poets: Ode, Elegy, Epigram, Fragment, Song",ENGLISH 50 ," Poets: Ode, Elegy, Epigram, Fragment, Song","Description:  Poetry, lyric and otherwise: how to read it, hear it, and write about it, from the 16th century to the present, with forms and models from Shakespeare, Keats and Dickinson to Herrera, Kasischke or Agbabi. Assignments include critical papers but also ""imitation of great masters"" (as Yeats put it); we'll study poems both in and out of the historical contexts that made them possible, and we'll ask why those that endure have endured."
ENGLISH 62D - Migrations: Literature of Displacement,ENGLISH 62D , Migrations: Literature of Displacement,"Description:  A displacement can take place in our lives in the sense of moving, or being moved, from one location to another. From the nautical sense we also understand any volume, which fills or occupies a liquid space that changes to accommodate it, a useful metaphor for intellectual displacements?as we bend, shift and make room for new ideas in our minds. In psychology, a displacement is the transference of a site of trauma from one person, scenario, or object to another. Finally, there are histories of human displacement, a broad category under which to consider narratives generated by migration, emigration, exile, and enslavement. In this seminar we will read from texts that contribute in all of these ways, often interrelated, to a ?literature of displacement.? We will read novels, essays, and memoirs by Joseph Conrad, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, James Baldwin, Tayeb Salih, Valeria Luiselli, and W.G. Sebald and watch films by Les Blank, Charles Burnett, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Edward Yang among others. We will ask how these works respond to the trials and rewards of belonging to, or being alienated from, cultures and communities; how history and loss imprint us with identity but also disrupt it; what we learn from encountering other places and perspectives. Can remembering, witnessing, and storytelling create a place for our selves in a world founded on an ongoing and massive experience of perpetual displacement?"
ENGLISH 64 - Migrations: American Renaissance and Irish Revival,ENGLISH 64 , Migrations: American Renaissance and Irish Revival,"Description:  Case studies in the formation of national literatures. In the 1850s, a new generation of American authors suddenly came into its own (Dickinson, Emerson, Hawthorne, Melville, Thoreau, Whitman); in the early 1900s, something similar happened in Ireland (Joyce, O'Casey, Synge, Yeats). In both cases, a national literature emerged in rebellion against the literature of Britain, and, in both cases, the literature that emerged would go on to inspire other post-colonial literatures around the world."

As we survey a series of twentieth-century juridical paradigms (trials, rights, reparations, and reconciliation), our goal will not be to judge the efficacy of literary and legal projects, but rather to study how they imagine issues of guilt, responsibility, testimony, commemoration, apology and forgiveness. Our readings will include novels, short stories, poetry, legal theory, documentaries, and key documents of international law: authors will most likely include Hannah Arendt, J.M. Coetzee, Jacques Derrida, Franz Kafka, Michael Ondaatje, Julie Otsuka, and M. NourbeSe Philip."

ENGLISH 90RG - Recognitions,ENGLISH 90RG , Recognitions,"Description:  What if originality were not what strikes us most forcefully in art? What, instead, if recognition of what and whom we have known already is the most emotionally forceful, illuminating experience of art? This course will test the force of these propositions, by looking to both visual art (painting and movies) and literature. We will look to rhetoric, cognitive psychology and philosophy in order to understand the artistic experience of recognition. Texts will be drawn anywhere from Homer to Shakespeare in Love."

Andersen, Lewis Carroll, J.M. Barrie, and J.K. Rowling."
"FOLKMYTH 156 - On the Road: Traffic, Migrations, and Other Sorts of (Im)Mobilities",FOLKMYTH 156 ," On the Road: Traffic, Migrations, and Other Sorts of (Im)Mobilities","Description:  The current global moment carries the mark of border-crossings and transgressions where not only people are on the move, but also ideas and images about them. The refugee, the migrant, and the terrorist - while itinerant figures of different orders - they all inspire particular narratives about what constitutes ""human nature"" and inhumane practices. This course explores the multiple meanings of mobility and stasis by examining the (dis)placement and circulation of people and things along with the (folk)tales that accompany ""being on the road."" New roads through rainforests can bring improved economic conditions to rural areas; they can also bring disease and environmental destruction. So-called ""uncontacted"" tribes still inhabit in parts of the Amazon rainforest and Bedouin tribes continue to trouble Middle Eastern states. These nomadic populations present a challenge to state politicians, in theory because they represent a nomadic legacy and the possibility of insurrection, along with the belief that they cannot coexist with the modern, fixed, nation-state. French thinkers Deleuze &amp; Guattari write that ""[h]istory is always written from the sedentary point of view and in the name of a unitary State apparatus, at least a possible one, even when the topic is nomads. What is lacking is a Nomadology, the opposite of a history."" So what does a mobile history or global outlook sound like if not told from the sedentary point of view? How do our perspectives on movement inform notions (or realizations) of peace, war, progress, and development? And what does it mean to tell a tale in motion? From the side of the road and on the highway, who and what can move or stay -- as well as who can tell the tale -- has defined those people and things gain and maintain social value. Among the diverse array of authors and central figures for this course are: Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Miriam Camitta, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, Jodi Byrd, as well as historically heroic actors such as Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass. We will also honor the thousands of unnamed refugees crossing state borders via land, air, and water every day. While the course has a focus on the Americas, Africa, (some readings on South East Asia) and European colonialism, the class discussions, presentations, and certainly the assignments provide space to examine migrations and mobilities on the global scale.Readings and discussions will engage the topics of: spatial productions of power and knowledge-making; movement that occurs through terrestrial, aquatic, cyber and outer-space, border-crossings; disability studies; trans-national development projects and environmental disasters; nomads and refugees."
FOLKMYTH 177 - Assertive Stitches: Domestic Arts and Public Conflict,FOLKMYTH 177 , Assertive Stitches: Domestic Arts and Public Conflict,"Description:  In January 2017, the Pussy Hat Project turned the Women?s March on Washington into an eye-catching ?sea of pink,? but this is not the first time that needlework has played an important role in a political demonstration. Needlework?s traditional associations with femininity and domesticity have made it a potent symbol in protests that are critical of traditional gender roles, or that evoke domestic morality to challenge public policy, or in some cases, both. In addition to the 2017 Pussy Hat project, we will look at cases like the ongoing NAMES Project AIDS memorial quilt, and the anti-nuclear-arms Piece Ribbon project of the mid-1980s within broader historical and theoretical contexts of needlework, of protest and demonstration, and of collective and/or community-building artistic practices."

FRSEMR 21H - Modern Civilization and the Rise of Heart Disease,FRSEMR 21H , Modern Civilization and the Rise of Heart Disease,"Description:  Heart diseases have plagued humans since ancient times, but only in the past century has heart disease become epidemic throughout the world. Despite great progress in prevention and therapy, heart diseases will be major causes of death and disability throughout the next century. Modernization of civilization has played a major role in the rise of heart disease. Conversely, advances in heart disease have powerfully changed society and our personal daily behavior. In this seminar, we will examine some of the major intersection events between heart disease and modern society over the past century and consider how this could change the next century in America and throughout the world. The topics include dramatic events like a young physician inserting a urinary drainage tube into his heart?ultimately generating the modern life-saving treatment for heart attacks. We will explore how major lifestyle factors such as tobacco, alcohol, exercise and diet affect health, and how economics and politics often play a role in the complex relationship of health and society. In addition, we will visit a high-technology modern cardiology facility and watch some technology in action."
"FRSEMR 21R - The Evolutionary Transition From Dinosaurs To Birds: Fossils, Genomes and Behavior",FRSEMR 21R ," The Evolutionary Transition From Dinosaurs To Birds: Fossils, Genomes and Behavior","Description:  The transition of dinosaurs to modern birds is one of the most rapidly advancing and increasingly complete records of evolutionary change in the vertebrate fossil record. Additionally it is an excellent model for how science builds on incremental discoveries and undergoes paradigm shifts as new data are collected. We will explore the dinosaurian origins of modern birds through exploration of Harvard's excellent collections of dinosaur fossils, skeletons and specimens of extant birds, and focused readings and discussions. The goal will be to gain a greater appreciation of dinosaur diversity and to better understand the deep origins of modern bird adaptations."
"FRSEMR 21V - Black Holes, String Theory and the Fundamental Laws of Nature",FRSEMR 21V ," Black Holes, String Theory and the Fundamental Laws of Nature","Description:  The quest to understand the fundamental laws of nature has been ongoing for centuries. This seminar will assess the current status of this quest. In the first five weeks we will cover the basic pillars of our understanding: Einstein?s theory of general relativity, quantum mechanics and the Standard Model of particle physics. We will then examine the inadequacies and inconsistencies in our current picture, including for example the problem of quantum gravity, the lack of a unified theory of forces, Dirac?s large numbers problem, the cosmological constant problem, Hawking?s black hole information paradox, and the absence of a theory for the origin of the universe. Attempts to address these issues and move beyond our current understanding involve a network of intertwined investigations in string theory, M theory, inflation and non-abelian gauge theories and have drawn inspiration from the study and observation of black holes, gravitational waves and developments in modern mathematics. These forays beyond the edge of our current knowledge will be reviewed and assessed."
FRSEMR 23H - Anatomy and Ethical Transgressions in National Socialism,FRSEMR 23H , Anatomy and Ethical Transgressions in National Socialism,"Description:  This course introduces students to the history and ethics of anatomy, and their relevance for current questions in medicine concerning the human body in life and death. The story of anatomy in National Socialist (NS or Nazi) Germany is an example of ethical transgressions in the anatomical sciences and reveals the complex relationship between anatomists and the Nazi regime. The historic causes of this development will be explored by examining the roots of the biologistic NS ideology in the connections between anatomy, physical anthropology, the global eugenics movement and German racial hygiene. Many anatomists became members of the NS party, while others were persecuted for so-called ?racial? and political reasons. An examination of the history of anatomical body procurement from ancient Greece to the 21st century demonstrates the changes of the traditional sources of bodies for anatomical dissection under NS rule, resulting in the use of many bodies of NS victims for anatomical purposes. Anatomical research changed with the exploitation of the rising number of bodies of executed men and women. Case studies of the work of individual anatomists reveal a gradual shift in the paradigm of anatomy. A few anatomists left the traditional paradigm- i.e. the gain of anatomical knowledge through work with the dead- in favor of a new paradigm- i.e. work with the ?future dead?- in human experiments on prisoners who were subsequently murdered. Ultimately, anatomists became complicit with the government through their role in the complete destruction of the perceived ?enemies? of the NS regime."
FRSEMR 23I - GeoSciFi Movies: Real vs. Fiction,FRSEMR 23I , GeoSciFi Movies: Real vs. Fiction,"Description:  Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions have major impact on society and cause great tragedies. The participants in this seminar will examine one Earth-science related science fiction movie each week and discusses features that are real and fictitious based upon our current understanding of the science of disastrous events. Simple math and science concepts are used to test how likely some effects are (e.g., is magnitude 11 earthquake possible and why?), and to understand the underlying science behind these features (e.g., what are the factors that control the size of an earthquake?). If applicable, we discuss how these scientific ideas are exaggerated to dramatize the effects."
"FRSEMR 23L - Medicine, Law, and Ethics: An Introduction",FRSEMR 23L ," Medicine, Law, and Ethics: An Introduction","Description:  The seminar explores medical, legal, and ethical aspects of medical care, with particular attention to medical decision-making at the beginning and end of life, participants in research on human subjects, human reproductive technologies, mental illness, and experimentation on animals. Historical background of present-day medical practices and relevant law to be discussed."
"FRSEMR 23P - Physics, Math and Puzzles",FRSEMR 23P ," Physics, Math and Puzzles","Description:  Physics is a highly developed branch of science with a broad range of applications. Despite the complexity of the universe the fundamental laws of physics are rather simple, if viewed properly. This seminar will focus on intuitive as well as mathematical underpinnings of some of the fundamental laws of nature. The seminars will use mathematical puzzles to introduce the basic features of physical laws. Main aspects discussed include the role of symmetries as well as the power of modern math, including abstract ideas in topology, in unraveling the mysteries of the universe. Examples are drawn from diverse areas of physics including string theory. The issue of why the universe is so big, as well as its potential explanation is also discussed."
FRSEMR 23S - The Seven Sins of Memory,FRSEMR 23S , The Seven Sins of Memory,"Description:  How do we remember and why do we forget? Can we trust our memories? How is memory affected by misinformation such as ?fake news?? Do smartphones and the Internet help our memories or hurt them? Are traumatic experiences especially well remembered or are they poorly remembered? What are the best ways to study for exams? This seminar will address these and other questions related to the fallibility of memory by considering evidence from studies of healthy people with normal memories, brain-damaged patients who show dramatic forgetting or striking memory distortions, and neuroimaging studies that reveal brain regions and networks that are linked to memory. The framework for the seminar is provided by the idea that the misdeeds of memory can be classified into seven basic ""sins"". Three of the memory sins refer to different kinds of forgetting (transience, absent-mindedness, and blocking), three refer to different kinds of distortions or false memories (misattribution, suggestibility, and bias) and the final sin refers to intrusive recollections (persistence). We will consider how the memory sins impact everyday life and discuss the possibility that they can be conceptualized as by-products of adaptive features of memory, rather than as flaws in the system or blunders made by Mother Nature during evolution. Relatedly, we will also discuss the interplay between remembering past experiences and imagining future experiences, which provides clues regarding the nature and fallibility of memory."
FRSEMR 24E - The Physics and Applied Physics Freshman Research Laboratory,FRSEMR 24E , The Physics and Applied Physics Freshman Research Laboratory,"Description:  This year's Freshman Seminar will enable students with musical training to bridge this knowledge with Physics, Mathematics, software and hardware via experimentation with sound and music. Teams will be guided by faculty, staff and a practicing software entrepreneur. The course will be accessible to students with an interest in science/engineering and who currently play a musical instrument, at least at an elementary level."
FRSEMR 24G - A Brief History of Surgery,FRSEMR 24G , A Brief History of Surgery,"Description:  The history of surgery begins with the Hippocratic physicians whose principles were based, at least partly, on observation and measurement. However, surgical thinking for first three quarters of the ?modern era? was dominated by Galen of Pergamum who, ?fooled by his monkeys,? established a school thought as false as it was tightly held. The exposure of Galen?s errors by Vesalius in 1543 and Harvey in 1628 began a Medical Enlightenment. It would take until the 19th century for the next era of discovery to begin. During this time, the pace and significance of medical discovery increase, yet adoption of good ideas, like antisepsis, seems to take much too long, while bad ideas find adherents in spite of poor or no supporting evidence. Throughout this period, the ghost of Galen continues to haunt hospitals and battlefields. It will not be until the 1930?s that Galenism is banished from the wards. Our study will track this history and conclude with a consideration of the management of combat casualties from the time of the first ?modern? surgeon, Ambrose Pare, to that of contemporary forward surgical teams in Afghanistan and Iraq. The seminar will consist of weekly discussion, informed by assigned reading and independent inquiry. We will visit the site of the first use of ether anesthesia, and duplicate William Harvey?s experiments in the anatomy lab. From time to time we will be joined by other doctors with expertise in specific areas such as infectious disease, combat surgery and anatomy."
FRSEMR 24N - Child Health in America,FRSEMR 24N , Child Health in America,"Description:  How can American health care be improved for children? How a nation cares for its children?s health is often considered a measure of its commitment to the general citizenry and to its future. The members of the seminar will review together the history of children?s health and health care in the United States, exploring the impact of geography, environment, nutrition, clean water, as well as of the scientific discoveries of the late 19th century and the early 20th century and the emergence of the high technology care of the middle and late 20th century. Then they will pose the question, ?Does America provide children and youth the best possible health care available in the 21st century?? To approach this question, students will analyze the current causes of illness, disability and death among U.S. children and youth and compare United States epidemiology with that of other developed and developing nations. Students will also explore how child health delivery is financed."
FRSEMR 24P - Getting to Know Charles Darwin,FRSEMR 24P , Getting to Know Charles Darwin,"Description:  Do you think you know who Charles Darwin was? The legend and sober-looking bearded scholar behind the most important paradigm shift in human history? In this seminar, we will read a selection of Darwin's publications (including parts of Darwin's seminal work, On the Origin of Species), as well as his private correspondence, paying close attention to the man behind the science as revealed by his writings. We will get to know Charles Darwin?the avid breeder of pigeons, lover of barnacles, devoted father and husband, gifted correspondent and tactician, and remarkable backyard scientist. In this latter vein, we will reproduce ten of Charles Darwin's classic Down House experiments that were central to making his case for natural selection and evolution in On the Origin of Species, as well as his many other books on natural history. Field trips to the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and a local pigeon fancier will provide the setting for recreating a selection of the myriad observations of organisms and their interactions with the environment and each other that made Darwin the master of minutia and provided the foundation for his grand synthesis of evolutionary pattern and process. Each week, we will also read, react to (through writing), and discuss Darwin?s published writings and letters."
FRSEMR 24Q - Biology of Symbiosis: Living Together Can Be Fun!,FRSEMR 24Q , Biology of Symbiosis: Living Together Can Be Fun!,"Description:  This course examines the remarkable diversity of symbiotic associations on Earth, their ecology and evolution, and their roles in human health and disease, agriculture, and biotechnology. Symbioses - ""living together"" - with microbes are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from lichens to the human microbiome. Symbiosis drives evolution, resulting in ""new organisms"" and charges us to think about biodiversity on a new level. In this freshman seminar, microbial symbioses with animals (including humans), plants, fungi, protists will be discussed, complemented by microscopy and field trips to local environs including Boston Harbor Islands, the New England Aquarium, and your own microbiome."
FRSEMR 26J - The Universe's Hidden Dimensions,FRSEMR 26J , The Universe's Hidden Dimensions,"Description:  This seminar will give an overview and introduction to modern physics. As with the book, Warped Passages, on which it will be loosely based, the seminar will first consider the revolutionary developments of the early twentieth century: quantum mechanics and general relativity; and then it will investigate the key concepts which separated these developments from the physical theories which previously existed. We will then delve into modern particle physics and how theory and experiment culminated in the ""Standard Model of particle physics"" which physicists use today. Then we will move beyond the Standard Model into more speculative arenas, including supersymmetry, string theory, and theories of extra dimensions of space. We will consider the motivations underlying these theories, their current status, and how we might hope to test some of the underlying ideas in the near future."
FRSEMR 26Z - What is Life?,FRSEMR 26Z , What is Life?,"Description:  This seminar will consider the conditions of a cell necessary to support life. The central questions are: what are the principal constituents of the cell, what is the role of water in cellular activities, what determines the size of a cell, what are the consequences of crowding of the components of the cell, what is the role of diffusion in biological interactions, what is the energy currency of the cell, what are the critical reactions that provide energy for the cell, how does the cell evade the requirement for an increase in entropy for a spontaneous process. The proposal is to find a definition for a living system using information and principles of biology, chemistry and physics. Answers to the central questions may allow an understanding of the size of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, of the ionic composition of the cell cytoplasm, and of the involvement of molecular interactions and complementarity in cellular processes."
FRSEMR 27J - Prediction: From Ancient Omens to Modern Computer Simulations,FRSEMR 27J , Prediction: From Ancient Omens to Modern Computer Simulations,"Description:  We will discuss the variety of approaches humans have taken to predicting their own future. Early weeks will focus on omens, oracles, religion and prophecy. Next, we will move on to the so-called Scienti?c Revolution, exempli?ed by the work of Galileo, and the Age of Exploration, enabled by John Harrison?s solution to ?nding longitude at sea. The last several weeks of the seminar will focus predictive work in epidemiology, ?nance, and climate, and ultimately on work about the Universe?s future. The ?nal session will be a discussion of how computer models of health/wealth/climate combine to predict our future. Preparatory assignments will include readings and/or multimedia experiences relevant to the next week?s topic. Between meetings, students will be asked to make contributions to a course WordPress site, sometimes as answers to speci?c prompts (e.g. discuss a way in which Galileo?s predictions of Jupiter?s moons? orbits might have affected Renaissance ideas about determinism vs. free will?), and other times as links to and explanations of online (open multimedia) content that will enrich the (public) course record. A central goal in discussions will be to follow threads, such as ?nding the right level of skepticism when assessing the likely veracity of predictions, or considering sources of uncertainty, that connect the wide variety of predictive systems to be discussed. The course will o?er one ?eld trip, to Harvard?s Collection of Historical Scienti?c Instruments."
FRSEMR 27K - Energy: Be the Change,FRSEMR 27K , Energy: Be the Change,"Description:  In the US, energy use creates large political and social tensions and much emphasis is placed on climate change. In China, health issues surrounding energy use are emerging as a critical issue. Importantly, there are many areas where the role of energy is often overlooked. A large fraction of current geopolitical tensions arise from issues originating in energy consumption, and that fraction may increase as water use and energy use become more closely tied. Too many discussions of energy focus on one feature of the problem, without considering how a change in one area will inevitably ripple out with the power to transform our relationships with each other and with the physical world. Some of those ripple effects are enormously positive, others are not. The goal of the course will be to choose energy changes that we would like to happen and to form a realistic plan for making that change occur. An important feature of the discussion will be considerations about what is physically possible; however, the major emphasis will be on trying to understand the connections that will be altered by that change. Any change, however laudable, inevitably creates both winners and losers. For change to happen, losers must at least be brought to accept the change. One goal of the course will be to establish local and global forums that allow us to learn more about people?s reactions to proposals for energy change so that our proposals for change have a real possiblity of coming to pass."
FRSEMR 30G - Digging Egypt's Past: Harvard and Egyptian Archaeology,FRSEMR 30G , Digging Egypt's Past: Harvard and Egyptian Archaeology,"Description:  In 1905, Harvard University and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA), teamed up to conduct excavations in Egypt and Nubia (modern Sudan). No one knew then that the Harvard?MFA Expedition would run for forty-plus years, cover twenty-three different sites, and discover hundreds of thousands of artifacts, art masterpieces, and other treasures, as well as contribute fundamentally to our knowledge of ancient Egyptian history. Egyptologist, Harvard Professor, and MFA curator George Reisner (1867-1942) ran the Expedition from ?Harvard Camp,? his mud-brick headquarters just behind the famous Giza Pyramids. Reisner was ahead of his time in revolutionizing the development of responsible archaeological methods. This course takes a chronological tour in the footsteps of this historic dig, focusing on topics such as early Harvard and MFA history, the development of archaeological method in the early 20th century, Western imperialism and colonialism and the role of archaeology, current attitudes toward repatriation of cultural patrimony, and new technologies for studying the Expedition?s legacy. Students will access unpublished archival documents at Harvard and elsewhere, and will research important expedition members and events. Field trips to the Peabody Museum, the MFA, Harvard?s Visualization Center (3D Giza Pyramids), Harvard Semitic Museum, and other locations will bring the Expedition to life. The secret and mysterious burial of an Egyptian queen beside the Great Pyramid at Giza may form a special focus during parts of the semester."
FRSEMR 30Q - Death and Immortality,FRSEMR 30Q , Death and Immortality,"Description:  In this seminar, we will discuss philosophical questions about death and immortality. What is death? Is there a moral difference between ""brain death"" and the irreversible loss of consciousness? Is the classification of a person as dead a moral judgment, or is it an entirely scientific matter? Is death a misfortune to the person who dies? How can death be a misfortune if you are no longer around to experience that misfortune? Is it possible to survive after death? What does it mean for you to survive after your death? Is there such a thing as an immaterial soul distinct from your body? Is immortality something you should want in the first place? Even if you do not live forever, is it nevertheless important that humanity continues to exist after your death? By discussing these questions about death, we will hopefully gain insight about the importance and meaning of life."
FRSEMR 30X - The Life Project,FRSEMR 30X , The Life Project,"Description:  What happens when contemporary artists treat their everyday lives as artistic material, ""sculpting"" their eating, sleeping, or living habits and reporting on the process? What kind of art is this? In the era of reality TV, personal informatics, and ""challenge literature"" have such projects gone mainstream? How do they relate to the ""life projects"" of ascetics, experimental subjects, or the mentally ill?"
FRSEMR 31D - Nietzsche,FRSEMR 31D , Nietzsche,"Description:  Friedrich Nietzsche addresses some of the big questions of human existence in a profoundly searching but often disturbing manner that continues to resonate with many. Hardly any philosopher (except Karl Marx) has exercised such a far-reaching and penetrating impact on intellectual life in the last 150 years or so. He has influenced thinkers and activists across the political spectrum. Nietzsche has always been of special interest to young people who have often appreciated the irreverence and freshness of his thought, as well as the often very high literary quality of his writing. In this course, we explore Nietzsche's moral and political philosophy with emphasis on the themes he develops in his best-known and most accessible work, The Genealogy of Morality. The best-known themes from this book include the slave rebellion in morality, ressentiment, bad conscience, and ascetic ideals. However, we also read several other of Nietzsche?s works, and do so chronologically (except that we begin with his auto-biography, Ecce Homo, which Nietzsche wrote briefly before his mental collapse in 1889). The others works include The Birth of Tragedy, The Gay Science, Beyond Good and Evil, and The Antichrist. We do not read any secondary literature, though the instructor will recommend such literature as appropriate. The point is to become familiar with Nietzsche?s writings themselves and to engage with his thought."
FRSEMR 31J - Skepticism and Knowledge,FRSEMR 31J , Skepticism and Knowledge,"Description:  What can we know; how can we know it? Can I know that I am not a brain in a vat being manipulated into thinking that I have a body? Can I know that Lincoln was assassinated, that electrons have negative charge, that Hamlet is a masterpiece, that the sun will rise tomorrow? This seminar will study skeptical arguments and responses to them to explore the nature and scope of knowledge."
FRSEMR 31M - In Pursuit of the Ordinary: Genre Painting in Boston-Area Museums,FRSEMR 31M , In Pursuit of the Ordinary: Genre Painting in Boston,"Description:  This course focuses chiefly on ?genre? pictures: that is, depictions, mostly painted on canvas or panel, of everyday life. Examining closely key examples in different Boston-area collections, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (excursion scheduled below), we investigate the changing nature and context of this type of image from its rise as a specialty product in early modern Europe through its complex development in the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, to its rejection in Modernist art practice. Renewed fascination with the `ordinary? in contemporary art and in recent museology (that is, museum history, theory and practice) features in this course, as well. Today?s icons of the everyday (for example, Marcel Duchamp?s Fountain of 1917, Andy Warhol?s Brillo Box of 1964 boxes) obey a modern imperative that artists represent everyday life in suitably banal ways. Eschewing figural anecdote, artists dismantle art?s traditional claims of occupying some special ?higher? sphere; they confront viewers with estrangements of the things of the world we unthinkingly inhabit. Such works illuminate our pursuit within this course: We study how artists of the past pictured everyday life; but we also consider what people do with art in their everyday lives. And we explore what the discipline of art history, in its practices of scholarship, criticism, collection, preservation, and display, imagines the `ordinary? to be. This focus?our own image of the ordinary?takes us to museum spaces that intend to simulate everyday life. The gallery becomes itself a genre picture to stroll through. Although the course is structured around broad themes and historical developments, the emphasis of the classes will be on close visual analysis of objects and critical evaluation of key art historical texts."
FRSEMR 31N - Beauty and Christianity,FRSEMR 31N , Beauty and Christianity,"Description:  In Book X of The Confessions Augustine wrote, ""I have learned to love you late, Beauty at once so ancient and so new!"" In addressing God as source and model of beauty, Augustine joins theology and aesthetics in one sentiment that has informed and sometimes troubled Christianity throughout its history. There is no doubt that the life and teachings of Jesus have inspired some of the greatest works of art, literature, and music in Western culture, but it is also true that Christians have not always agreed on the definition and function of beauty. The seminar will consider certain key Christian aesthetic theories, including those of Augustine, Gregory the Great, Aquinas, and Calvin. But the focus will be on the analysis of particular works, selections from Dante's Paradiso, poems of Herbert, Donne, and G.M. Hopkins, The Little Flowers of St. Francis, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Hawthorne?s Scarlet Letter, Melville's Billy Budd, works of C.S. Lewis, and the short stories of Flannery O'Connor. Included as well will be paintings (eg Italian Renaissance depictions of Jesus, Mary, Mary Magdalene, John the Baptist, and St. Sebastian) and choral music (eg Bach's Saint Mathew Passion and selected African-American spirituals). The abiding question will be: In what ways does aesthetic form?beauty?enhance, qualify, complicate, or obscure the gospel?"
FRSEMR 32M - Food for Thought: Culinary Culture in Spain and Beyond,FRSEMR 32M , Food for Thought: Culinary Culture in Spain and Beyond,"Description:  The French have said that the history of a nation depends on what they eat. Yet in the case of Spain, it?s clearly the reverse. What Spain has eaten has been a consequence of the country?s vast -and often turbulent- history. Invasions, expansions, exile and immigration have created and continue to create the cuisine and culture, which will be our focus in this seminar. Likewise, we will consider Spain?s culinary exchange with Latin America, with specific reference to Argentina, Peru and the Caribbean. From don Quijote?s rudimentary repas, to Almodovar?s gazpacho, we?ll conclude at the tables of the globalized metropolis. We will first consider food and identity, then food, its rituals and traditions. We will examine Spain from the Middle Ages until the present, the history and regions of the peninsula, and the culinary consequences of transatlantic voyages. We will also consider the repercussions of Europeans arriving in the 19th century, and those of the many closer, traumatic events of the 20th century, and beyond. The readings, all in English, are by novelists, historians, chefs, food critics, sociologists, poets, cartoonists and travel writers over the span of ten centuries. The films and videos are more recent, and will have subtitles. No previous knowledge of Spanish language, or travel to any of the countries mentioned, is required. Neither do prospective students need extensive cooking skills. The only pre-requisite is curiosity about what, why, and how the people of Spain and Latin America have eaten throughout their history, and how this reflects identity and culture of these lands."
"FRSEMR 33C - Borges, Garcia Marquez, Bolano and Other Classics of Modern Latin American Literature",FRSEMR 33C ," Borges, Garcia Marquez, Bolano and Other Classics of Modern Latin American Literature","Description:  This course introduces students to some of the most important Latin American literary works produced during the twentieth century. We will explore the ways in which these novels, short-stories, essays and poems interrogate the historical traumas, political contexts and aesthetic potential of the region between 1920s and 1980s. We will shed light on their place in the historical and cultural formation of the literary canon, as well as on the concept of `classic?. The goal of this seminar is two-fold. On the one hand, it introduces students to the Latin American literary and critical tradition through some of the best and most interesting literary and critical works (each novel or grouping of short stories and poems are paired with an important critical essay that situates them historically and aesthetically). On the other, it provides them with the fundamental skills of literary analysis (close reading, conceptual and historical framing, continuities and discontinuities with the aesthetic tradition), and that is why I have selected a relatively small number of readings, in order to have time to work through them, discuss them and have some flexibility to extend the classes we dedicate to a given author when our discussions merit it."
FRSEMR 33X - Complexity in Works of Art: Ulysses and Hamlet,FRSEMR 33X , Complexity in Works of Art: Ulysses and Hamlet,"Description:  Is the complexity, the imperfection, the difficulty of interpretation, the unresolved meaning found in certain great and lasting works of literary art a result of technical experimentation? Or is the source extreme complexity?psychological, metaphysical, or spiritual? Does it result from limits within language, or from language?s fit to thought and perception? Do the inherited forms found in literature permit only certain variations within experience to reach lucidity? Is there a distinction in literature between what can be said and what can be read? The members of the seminar will investigate the limits literature faces in giving an account of mind, everyday experience, thought, memory, full character, and situation in time. The seminar will make use of a classic case of difficulty, Shakespeare?s Hamlet, and a modern work of unusual complexity and resistance to both interpretation and to simple comfortable reading, Joyce?s Ulysses. Reading in exhaustive depth these two works will suggest the range of meanings for terms like complexity, resistance, openness of meaning, and experimentation within form."
FRSEMR 34F - The Folklore of Gaelic Scotland,FRSEMR 34F , The Folklore of Gaelic Scotland,"Description:  This course explores the `treasure house? of Gaelic folklore recorded in the Highlands of Scotland since the nineteenth century. The international controversy over Macpherson?s 'Ossian' poems in the 1760s prompted interest in the Scottish Gaelic folklore from which they were adapted. Folklorists have since documented a wealth of orally recorded material, including tales of ancient heroes (e.g. Finn McCool) and beliefs in malevolent fairies, seal-people, dangerous water-horses, the evil eye and second sight. As we explore these fascinating topics, we will take into account international scholarly approaches to folklore."
FRSEMR 34X - Language and Prehistory,FRSEMR 34X , Language and Prehistory,"Description:  It was discovered around 1800 that the major languages of Europe, along with the ancient languages of India and Iran, were descended from an unattested parent, formerly known as ""Aryan"" or ""Indo-Germanic,"" but today usually called Proto-Indo-European. The identification of the Indo-European family raised many questions, some purely linguistic (e.g., what was Proto-Indo-European like; was it grammatically complex or ""primitive""?), and some more far-reaching (e.g., who were the speakers of Proto-Indo-European; why did Indo-European languages spread so widely?). Questions of the first type eventually led to the birth of the new academic field of linguistics. Questions of the second type, however, misled some nineteenth- and early twentieth-century intellectuals to posit a genetically and culturally superior Aryan ""race."" Although this idea is now universally rejected, linguistic evidence still plays an important role in studies of the past. Recent debates about the origins of ""Western civilization,"" for example, center on the alleged presence of borrowed Egyptian words in Greek, while theories about the settlement of the Americas depend on supposed linguistic connections between the New World and other continents. This seminar will explore the use and misuse of such methods. What, if anything, does the fact that languages are related tell us about their speakers? How can we distinguish genuine cases of linguistic borrowing or ""influence"" from the kinds of resemblances that come about through pure chance? Answers to these and similar questions will be sought through case studies, with readings chosen to illustrate and contrast scholarly and unscholarly approaches. The work for the course will consist of readings, four or five short problem sets, and a final project with both written and oral components."
FRSEMR 35N - The Art and Craft of Acting,FRSEMR 35N , The Art and Craft of Acting,"Description:  We?ve all watched a great performance and wondered, ?How did that actor do that?? Acting is undoubtedly the most popular, most widely experienced of the performing arts and yet, in many ways, it remains a mystery. This seminar will give students an opportunity to demystify the art of acting by introducing them to the basic tools of the trade; they will learn about the craft of acting by actually ?doing? it. It will provide an introduction to acting by combining elements of a discussion seminar with exercises, improvisations and performance activities. Improvisation will be used to improve group/ensemble dynamics minimize habitual behaviors and to develop characters. Students will explore a range of acting techniques designed to give students greater access to their creativity, imagination and emotional life. The aim will be to improve skills that are essential to the acting process, like concentration, focus, relaxation, observation, listening, etc. In the later part of the term students will work on monologues. Students will also attend and critique productions at the Loeb Drama Center and other theaters in the Boston area."
FRSEMR 36J - Folklore and the Culture of Childhood,FRSEMR 36J , Folklore and the Culture of Childhood,"Description:  This course begins by examining the stories of Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen and explores the migration of fairy tales into literary and cinematic cultures for adults and for children. From fairy tales we turn to fantasy literature and to the great counterfactuals in Other Worlds constructed for children. Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and Neil Gaiman's Ocean at the End of the Lane will guide us through our investigation of what Graham Greene called the ""excitement and revelation"" of books read in childhood."
FRSEMR 36P - To Far Places: Literature of Journey and Quest,FRSEMR 36P , To Far Places: Literature of Journey and Quest,"Description:  In this course, we read a highly diverse group of engaging texts in English translation. Most are fictional, mythic, or epic texts. All engage the theme of journey, quest, pilgrimage, passage, or sojourning. We will be attentive to enduring themes and basic questions associated with this varied literature, including parting and return, separation and reintegration, homelessness and homecoming, epic adventure and exploration, trial and suffering, loss and recovery, heroic action, tragedy, pathos, orientation and disorientation, internal and external travel, faith and courage, aesthetic vision, heightened perception, self-discovery and growth, companionship, loneliness, risk, and death. Readings will be selected from among the following: Gilgamesh, J.R.R. Tolkien?s Hobbit, Homer?s Odyssey, Virgil?s Aeneid, Matsuo Basho's Narrow Road to Oku, Hermann Hesse?s Siddhartha, Thomas Mann?s Death in Venice, Rudyard Kipling?s The Man Who Would be King, Ashvagosha?s Life of the Buddha, Shusaku Endo's Deep River, Annie Dillard?s Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, John Hersey?s A Single Pebble, Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain, Fariduddin Attar?s Conference of the Birds, Naguib Mahfouz's Journey of Ibn Fattouma, Cormac McCarthy's The Road, Rachel Joyce's The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, and Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities."
FRSEMR 36S - Comparative Historical Mythology,FRSEMR 36S , Comparative Historical Mythology,"Description:  This seminar will deal with an innovative approach to comparative Mythology, detailed in my 700 pp. book on the topic (OUP, Dec. 2012). Comparative mythology has been a well-trodden but controversial field since at least 1800. The proposed seminar will discuss the matter in a new way by incorporating an historical approach, which has so far been lacking. The two most prominent explanations for the wide-spread, worldwide similarities in myths have been archetypes (C.G. Jung) and diffusion (L. Frobenius / H. Baumann). Both approaches are inadequate to explain these similarities. Approaching myths historically, and working backwards from our earliest written sources (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Levant, India, China, Maya, etc.), earlier stages in the development of mythologies can be detected through successive reconstructions. These are supported by the additional testimony of oral texts found across the globe. Further, recent developments in human population genetics as well as in archaeology, anthropology and comparative linguistics sustain the proposed historical model, which ultimately, but rather tentatively, reaches back to the time of the ?African Eve.? This seminar will investigate the ways myths have been compared in the past; further, the underlying assumptions about human spirituality and religion, as well as available scientific evidence for such models. The new historical and comparative proposal will be tested against this evidence. All of this offers a wide scope for students? class room intervention and individual research in a multitude of ancient and oral texts (in translations) from a variety of languages as well as in the sciences."
FRSEMR 36X - Money Matters,FRSEMR 36X , Money Matters,"Description:  Money Matters aims to engage first-year students with the economics, politics and aesthetics of one of the most fascinating and enduring aspects in human history. The seminar is a study of money in all its manifestations from the early agrarian societies to the first financial crisis of the 21st-century global market. How have individuals and societies reacted to and used money in business, politics and religion? What are the factors that shaped the metallic content and iconography of coins from the 7th century BC to the end of the Gold Standard in the 20th century? Why are early modern American and European banknotes so important for the study of social history? What are the links between art, literature, theatre, cinema and money? Seminar meetings will take place at the Harvard College, the Harvard Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts and the Harvard Art Museums, introducing students to the world-class Harvard Coin Collection and offering them the opportunity to handle research and discuss priceless artifacts. Money Matters is intended for students with an interest in history, art history, archaeology, political science, economics and the study of world religions. Handling sessions, group discussions and a short essay on a choice coin from the Harvard Coin Collections will offer students a sense of immediacy and accessibility of Harvard?s splendid numismatic holdings and the opportunity to understand why money makes indeed the world go round."
FRSEMR 37Y - Muslim Voices in Contemporary World Literatures,FRSEMR 37Y , Muslim Voices in Contemporary World Literatures,"Description:  What do Muslims think of acts of terrorism committed in the name of Islam, the mixing of religion with politics, the rights of women, the ``West''? This seminar investigates the viewpoints of prominent Muslim writers on these and other ``hot button'' issues as reflected in novels, short stories and poetry from different parts of the world. Explores a range of issues facing Muslim communities in various parts of the world by examining the impact of colonialism, nationalism, globalization and politicization of Islam on the search for a modern Islamic identity. Readings of Muslim authors from the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Europe and America."
FRSEMR 40I - The Supreme Court in U.S. History,FRSEMR 40I , The Supreme Court in U.S. History,"Description:  Often described as the world's most powerful court, the US Supreme Court has not always enjoyed high prestige or unquestioned authority. The Court's significance has waxed and occasionally waned, with the variations typically depending on surrounding currents in the nation's social and political history. Examines the history of the Court from the nation's founding to the present. Highlights relation between constitutional law and ordinary politics, and the ways in which they influence one another."
FRSEMR 40L - Free Speech,FRSEMR 40L , Free Speech,"Description:  In this age of rapid globalization and heightened cross-cultural contacts, nations struggle to reaffirm their identities and values. In the United States, one of the most precious values is free speech, embedded in the First Amendment to the Constitution and regarded as a keystone of American democracy. But arguments over the boundaries of free speech have become intense, especially in the era of electronic communication. This seminar will examine the dialogue taking place within the United States and around the world on free speech issues ? sometimes civil, but often a political or cultural confrontation that turns violent. We will discuss international and domestic protests over politically sensitive cartoons, controversies over Holocaust denial, whether hate speech should be banned on campuses, whether the domestic media can ever be legitimately constrained on national security grounds, whether anti-gay religious activists have a right to disrupt military funerals, whether pornography and violent music lyrics should be regulated, and what constitutes free speech on the Internet or cell phones. Through Supreme Court decisions and by other means, we will examine the debate over what it means to be patriotic and whether patriotism requires Americans to say, or prohibits them from saying, certain things ? and examine how standards have changed over the years. We will ask whether other countries' attitudes toward free speech and the other First Amendment freedoms should influence US foreign policy toward those countries. Examples of constraints on free speech in our daily lives and work, unwitting or not, will also be considered."
FRSEMR 40P - Making the Grade? Middle and High School Math Education in the U.S.,FRSEMR 40P , Making the Grade? Middle and High School Math Education in the U.S.,"Description:  What are the goals of mathematics education at the middle and high school level, and how do these goals impact our evaluation of the success or failure of math education in America? Why does math education at these levels matter? What societal structures (historic, economic, political, cultural) impact mathematics education? How does math education in turn impact societal structures? As the world changes, how do the goals of mathematics education change, and in what ways? We will explore these issues to become more educated participants in this ongoing discussion."
FRSEMR 41D - Sick and Tired of being Sick and Tired: Health Disparities and African Americans,FRSEMR 41D , Sick and Tired of being Sick and Tired: Health Disparities and African Americans,"Description:  Since the arrival of Africans from Africa to America, their health and health care has been a critical issue for the nation. From the era of slavery to the present, African Americans have been disproportionately burdened by disease and ill health. Health disparities are the ?inequalities that occur in the provision of healthcare and access to healthcare across different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups.? This course examines this issue over the long time frame from the 17th century to the present. Currently, compared to the white population, African Americans are at an overall greater risk for many serious and life threatening diseases. This course will examine how these disparities emerged over time. It will explore the strategies and practices that African Americans employed to improve their health care. It will also examine, the ways that cities, states and the federal government supported or ignored the health of African Americans."
"FRSEMR 41K - Human Rights, Law and Advocacy",FRSEMR 41K ," Human Rights, Law and Advocacy","Description:  Human rights practitioners confront numerous ethical, strategic, and legal dilemmas in their struggles for social justice. This freshman seminar explores the underlying legal framework in which human rights advocates operate, and then uses specific case studies to consider the various challenges they must grapple with in their work. The seminar is designed to encourage students to critically evaluate the human rights movement while offering an introduction to some of the essential tools and strategies used by human rights advocates, including advocacy, litigation, documentation, and report writing. Students will be asked to grapple with tough questions, such as: How can human rights be harnessed to successfully influence and change behavior? What does responsible, effective human rights advocacy look like? How do we engage without perpetuating power differentials along geopolitical, class, race, gender, and other lines? How do we find ways to work in collaboration with directly affected communities? What does it mean to be a human rights advocate working on abuses affecting individuals and communities remote from yourself? How do you balance broader advocacy goals with the needs of individual survivors or clients? How do you determine when to intervene and devote limited resources to a given issue? Students will also consider a series of dynamics (e.g., north/south, insider/outsider, donor/donee, lawyer/non-lawyer) that influence how and why advocacy is formulated and received. Finally, the seminar considers the limits of the human rights paradigm and established methodologies, such as litigation and ?naming and shaming,? and explores alternative sources and forms of advocacy, including the role of community lawyering in the human rights context."
FRSEMR 41P - American Presidential Campaigns and Elections 1960-2016,FRSEMR 41P , American Presidential Campaigns and Elections 1960,"Description:  For two hours each week, students will work to understand the history, forces and politics of American presidential campaigns and elections. Each student will be ?responsible? for one presidential election between 1960 and 2016, and, together, members of the seminar will develop some perspective on dramatic changes as well as enduring factors that have shaped our own times, issues and society. With the help of some guests ? practitioners including political leaders, public opinion analysts and journalists ? students will develop a deeper understanding of contemporary politics; the impact of demographic patterns and changes; public opinion and polling; and political communication. Students will learn about the relationship among politics, news and public opinion, and who influences whom. Participants will be introduced to excellent contemporary studies about modern presidential campaigns and elections. At the end of the term, students will make oral reports to the class on lessons learned from a past election which can help all of us better understand this one."
FRSEMR 41R - Media in American Politics,FRSEMR 41R , Media in American Politics,"Description:  This course considers the degree to which Americans' political opinions and actions are influenced by the media as well as the influence of the media on public policy. Topics to be covered include the history of the mass media, recent trends in the media, theories of media effects, the implications for politics of changes in media (e.g., the rise of the Internet, social media and partisan media), the ways in which the news shapes the public's perceptions of the political world, campaign communication, how the media affect the manner in which public officials govern, and the general role of the media in the democratic process."
FRSEMR 42H - The U.S. Energy Revolution and its Implications,FRSEMR 42H , The U.S. Energy Revolution and its Implications,"Description:  How we produce and use energy has major implications for the economy, energy security, and climate change. The U.S. ?energy revolution? ? nonconventional oil and gas production (fracking), increasing use of renewable energy, and reduced demand ? has contributed to a sharp decline in U.S. oil imports, a 10% reduction in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. This course examines the changing U.S. energy landscape, energy security, U.S. climate policy, and the connection between these issues and our own lives. The conceptual framework is economics (but no prior economics is assumed), a powerful tool for understanding market failures and for designing government policies that are efficient, effective, and appropriate. The course starts by looking at our ? your ? energy and carbon footprint, how much it can change, and how it connects with broader issues of energy markets, energy security, and climate change. The course then dives into three current policy issues: biofuels, the mining of coal from public lands, and the regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. In each case, critics complain that these policies are expensive, ineffective, and/or have unintended consequences, while others complain that they don?t go far enough given the magnitude of the challenge posed by climate change, and we will evaluate these arguments."
FRSEMR 43C - Human Rights and the Global South,FRSEMR 43C , Human Rights and the Global South,"Description:  Human rights have become a global lingua franca, invoked by leaders and movements across the political, religious and cultural spectrum. Because they can come into conflict with each other, human rights can serve to justify wars (to combat terrorists), religious intolerance (to counter fundamentalists), gender discrimination (to support religious tenets), refusal of safe haven to refugees (to promote domestic human security). Despite over half a century of international law making and domestic enactment of human rights treaties, and despite a vibrant civil society that has embraced human rights principles world-wide, remedies for violations such as torture, rape, genocide, political or economic persecution, and crippling destitution, remain elusive. This dilemma is particularly clear in situations of forced migration, when vulnerable populations are separated from individuals and institutions that traditionally provide support. This seminar will focus on the Global South and address key issues in contemporary human rights theory and practice through the lens of displaced, disenfranchised, and threatened individuals and groups. Members of the seminar will first study the philosophical and political traditions that led to codification of human rights. The seminar will then cover the legal frameworks of contemporary international human rights and humanitarian law and examine how they affect some of the most egregious human rights violations of the current period. Case studies of pivotal controversies and decisions will be examined to explore such questions as who is a refugee or an internally displaced person (IDP), what is trafficking, when is deportation justified, what protections do civilians have in conflict settings, and what are major crimes of atrocity and war."
FRSEMR 43J - The Economist's View of the World,FRSEMR 43J , The Economist's View of the World,"Description:  This seminar probes how economic thinkers from the right and left view human behavior and the proper role of government in society. Each week, seminar participants read and discuss a brief, nontechnical, policy-oriented book by a prominent economist. There will also be required writing assignments. Students must have some background in economics, such as an AP economics course in high school or simultaneous enrollment in Economics 10."
"FRSEMR 43W - History, Nationalism, and the World: the Case of Korea",FRSEMR 43W ," History, Nationalism, and the World: the Case of Korea",Description:  The colonialism and postcolonial division of Korea into North and South thrust the memory of past events into current political discussions as well as scholarly debates. This seminar investigates selected events in Korean history to map the interaction between historical writing and politics and to address questions such as why historians have emphasized certain periods and aspects of Korean history while ignoring others.
"FRSEMR 44J - Clash of Titans, Seats of Empire: The Aztecs, Toltecs, and Race of Giants in Ancient Mexico",FRSEMR 44J ," Clash of Titans, Seats of Empire: The Aztecs, Toltecs, and Race of Giants in Ancient Mexico","Description:  The film ""Clash of Titans"" was a British extravaganza dedicated to exploring the ancient Greeks' concepts of the interactions between humans and their gods. In Ancient Mexico, the tale of Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl, Toltec Prince of Tula, is the best-known example of the intervention of rival gods, in the affairs of kingdoms and empires, and serves as the point of departure for our seminar. Just as the Greeks countenanced sacrifices and political assassinations, in Ancient Mexico the three great empires practiced human sacrifice, regicide, and engaged heavily in warfare which was vital in their statecraft and economy. We will explore how these central components were explained and justified in their mythology, why reciprocity with the gods was so vital, and how and why each empire came to a violent end. We begin with the first-person description of the Aztec Empire and its violent conquest, penned by a foot solider in Hernan Cortes's army, Bernal Diaz del Castillo. In the following weeks we will explore the environmental basis, religious dimensions, and social and political development of civilization, cities, at the three seats of empire in ancient Mexico. We will make extensive use of Peabody Museum collections, archaeological studies, historical accounts, and recent films and other media to critically examine ancient practices and current perceptions of the Aztec empire (1428-1519 CE); its predecessor the legendary Toltec empire of Tula (850-1100 CE); and the foundational Teotihuacan empire (100-550 CE), known as ?The City of the Gods? to people throughout the region. The Aztecs and Toltecs went to Teotihuacan on pilgrimage every 20 days, because the scale of that ancient city was so massive, the architecture so impressive, and the religious art and historical lore so compelling, that the Aztecs had a legend that it was built in an earlier creation, by a race of giants. Seminar participants will explore how the biases of the observer play a role in describing and explaining ?the Other.? Students will analyze the ways in which religion and the quest for power fueled the genesis, expansion and demise of all three empires. First-years in this seminar will also explore the ways in which the living descendants of the Aztecs are reviving their traditional culture and how the Pre-Columbian civilizations are integral to the national identity of Mexico and Chicanos in this country, vs. the way they are portrayed in Hollywood and U.S. popular culture, through films and other media in the U.S. and Mexico."
FRSEMR 48K - Political Legitimacy and Resistance: What Happened in Montaigne's Library on the Night of October 2,FRSEMR 48K , Political Legitimacy and Resistance: What Happened in Montaigne's Library on the Night of October 2,"Description:  Explores the theories of political legitimacy and justified resistance to authority developed by the persecuted Protestants during the French Wars of Religion, and traces the influence of these ideas about political obligation and religious conscience on some of the major figures in modern political philosophy from Hobbes to Kant. Students should be prepared to engage in both historical detective work and philosophical reflection. All required reading will be in English."
"FRSEMR 49G - The Holocaust in History, Literature, and Film",FRSEMR 49G ," The Holocaust in History, Literature, and Film","Description:  This seminar will approach the Nazi persecution of European Jewry from several disciplinary perspectives. Initially the seminar will explore the topic historically. In these weeks, the seminar will use a variety of historical materials dealing with the history of European anti-semitism, German history from Bismarck to the accession of Hitler, the evolution of anti-Jewish persecution in the Third Reich, and the history of the Holocaust itself. Sources to be used will include primary sources produced by the German government 1933-1945, by Jewish victims-to-be or survivors, documentary films, and secondary interpretations. The aims of this part of the seminar will be to understand the basic background to and narrative of the Holocaust, to introduce freshmen to the use of primary historical sources, and to familiarize them with some of the major historiographical debates. Then the members of the seminar will ponder religious and theological reactions to the Holocaust. Here the seminar will use literary and cinematic resources as well as discursive theological ones. The seminar will also consider the historical question of the role played by the Protestant and Catholic churches and theologies in the Holocaust. The seminar will conclude with an assessment of the role played by the Holocaust in today?s world, specifically in the United States. Throughout the seminar, participants will use various literary and cinematographic sources and test their limits in helping to understand and to represent the Holocaust."
FRSEMR 50I - The Temporal Universe,FRSEMR 50I , The Temporal Universe,"Description:  The Universe is not static, but rather stars and entire galaxies are evolving as revealed by their variability on timescales ranging from milliseconds for collapsed stars (neutron stars and black holes) to gigayears for stars and galaxies. In this seminar we shall explore stars and nuclei of galaxies through variability?from how brightness variability of stars with binary companions measured with small telescopes measures star masses and radii, to the extremes of variability of stars that undergo repeated huge flares, to enormously luminous variations from accretion onto gargantuan black holes in the nuclei of ?Active Galaxies? (blazars and quasars). We shall use the Clay Telescope on the Science Center roof to make some repeated observations (from the 8th floor Astronomy Lab) of several types of variable stars and accretion-powered binaries and deduce what life would be like if either were our Sun. From a blazar, we shall observe historical outbursts that occasionally change brightness to exceed its host galaxy by a factor of ~100, by using the digitized brightness measures on thousands of glass plate images taken by Harvard telescopes from 1885?1992 and now digitized and on-line from our digital access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) project. The seminar will include readings from an introductory astronomy text as well as both popular and journal articles and the short books Black Hole (Bartusiak) and Black Hole Blues (Levin). Students will use astronomical software to measure stellar brightness and variability from telescope images as well as learn temporal analysis techniques with applications to other disciplines. Students discuss in-class readings and observations conducted and write short papers on their observations and deductions."
FRSEMR 50M - How Stuff Works,FRSEMR 50M , How Stuff Works,"Description:  The rise of electronics-based technology has completely revolutionized the world over the last thirty years giving rise to new ways to be entertained, to communicate, and to work. Advancements in electronics have been primarily based on the chemistry and physics of new and improved electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of the underlying materials. This course will focus on discussing and understanding how stuff works with a particular focus on electronic and optical devices. In addition, we will learn about how magnetic stuff works, where color comes from, about modern fabrics, and other topics that students would find interesting. The course will also have the students read, research, and discuss what future innovations and technologies might be possible. Students will be encouraged to be active participants in prognostication. Students will have to write a paper on a future technology or innovation that they predict will be commonplace in the future or on the topic of how XXXX works."
FRSEMR 50R - What Do You See in the Night Sky?,FRSEMR 50R , What Do You See in the Night Sky?,"Description:  People around the world observe the same basic celestial phenomena- the rise and set of stars, the changing phases of the moon, the occasional bewildering eclipse. But cultures have come to interpret these signs very differently, giving rise to diverse calendar systems and mythological frameworks. For instance, the position of the sun, the visibility of star formations, and the lunar cycle have all been used to define the concept of the year, sometimes with more than one definition operating in a single culture. We will perform a survey of traditional astronomical systems, highlighting the original aspects of each and trying to understand the origin of differences. Why were some observations considered more significant than others (Which is more important, the shape of the moon or the identity of stars around it?)? How did mundane pressures, such as the need to sow and reap, influence how cultures tracked celestial motion? We will end with a more detailed exploration of the early Western and Arab astronomy. What specific advancements and conditions allowed them ultimately to ?get it right??"
FRSEMR 50U - Bio?Inspiration and Innovation,FRSEMR 50U , Bio?Inspiration and Innovation,"Description:  In the course of evolution, Nature has developed strategies that endow biological processes and materials with exquisite selectivity, specificity, and adaptability to a constantly changing environment. Learning from and mastering Nature's concepts not only satisfies humankind's insatiable curiosity for understanding the world around us, but also promises to drive a paradigm shift in modern materials science and technology. This seminar will explore some of the basic principles of biological architectures and the economy with which biology solves complex problems in the design of novel materials. It will give us a taste of how the inspiration from nature teaches us to break barriers in technology and disruptively innovate. Often nature?s solutions to engineering problems are so different from our conventional ways of thinking that the most fruitful way to investigate them is not immediately obvious. We will be therefore engaged in a continuous dialogue: we study the biological material itself to begin to understand its underlying principles, adapt these concepts to design a bio-inspired architecture, and then apply insights from the designed system to guide further investigation of the biological system. The goal is to use biological principles as guidance in developing new, bio-inspired materials and devices, with broad implications in fields ranging from architecture to energy efficiency to medicine."
FRSEMR 50Y - A Sense of Space (and Time),FRSEMR 50Y , A Sense of Space (and Time),"Description:  What is space? What is time? How have humans viewed these over the years? How are the views of these shaped by our environments and cultures? We often employ spatial metaphors for social situations ? e.g. ?they?re very close,? or ?they split apart.? It seems that as concepts of space change, and our horizons are broadened, these changes are reflected in a shift in cultural awareness. In this seminar, we explore concepts of space in a number of cultures: Pacific Islanders, Western Apache, Brazilian Rain forest, to name a few. The human mechanism of spatial cognition is examined, along with the reuse of these parts of the mind in future planning, memory, and imagination. As the seminar progresses, we focus in on the shifts of the concepts of space in Western culture ? starting with ancient Greeks and Egyptians. We examine the period when astronomy and astrology were practiced side-by-side, and then turn to the world of Dante Alighieri, where space was married to concepts of morality and culture. Finally, the development of physics and astronomy from Galileo to the present has seen seismic shifts in the concept of space-time. These in turn were reflected in broader cultural shifts."
FRSEMR 51K - Technology vs. Nature: From Toggling Harpoons to Geoengineering,FRSEMR 51K , Technology vs. Nature: From Toggling Harpoons to Geoengineering,"Description:  Are we at the end of nature? What would it mean if we were? Advanced hunting technologies enabled our ancestors to hunt so efficiently that the human expansion out of Africa drove a wave of extinctions around the globe. No more mammoths. No more moas. Over the last millennia, technological innovation has dramatically reduced many environmental impacts on a per capita basis; but, technology simultaneously enabled a population explosion and caused new forms of environmental disruption. Technology is simultaneously a despoiler and savior of the environment. We will explore the shifting frontier between the natural and artificial through critical examination of globally transformative technologies such as climate geoengineering, Haber-Bosh nitrogen fixation, gene-drives and de-extinction. Solar geoengineering is the idea that humanity could deliberately intervene in the Earth?s climate to limit the risks of accumulating carbon dioxide. It?s the focus of my own research. It serves as the central motivating case though which the class will explore broader questions about environmentalism in the 21st century. We will read selections from great environmental writings such as The End of Nature to Desert Solitaire along with new writing about the Anthropocene. I aim to help students find their own voice through writing short informal blog posts, commenting on posts by peers, and participating in class debate. The human connection to the natural world cannot be rightly understood in the abstract. So, we will take the class outside, from short explorations on campus, to an organized day-hike."
FRSEMR 60H - Faith and Fiction in American History,FRSEMR 60H , Faith and Fiction in American History,"Description:  This seminar uses key literary works to explore some of the most difficult and demanding questions in the religious history of the United States: Does God have a special relationship with the United States? Is sin an individual responsibility or a social flaw? Why has American religion been so frequently concerned with sexuality? How has religion shaped racial identities and tensions? How does it inform domestic relationships? How do non-Christian immigrants find a place and a voice in a nation with deeply entrenched Christian traditions? To explore these and other areas of concern, we bore into the faith-inflected cultures of American history through the imagined narratives of some of its most celebrated writers, including the likes of Catharine Sedgwick, Harriet Wilson, Flannery O?Connor, James Baldwin, Rudolfo Anaya, Pearl Abraham, Ayad Akhtar, and Marilynne Robinson. I will offer mini-lectures to contextualize these works in their historical moment. We will read some scholarly work to sharpen our tools of analysis, but mostly we will read and talk about the novels themselves. The seminar aims to be both analytically rigorous and aesthetically rewarding."
FRSEMR 60K - The Grail Quest of Marcel Proust,FRSEMR 60K , The Grail Quest of Marcel Proust,"Description:  We will read Chretien de Troyes? Tale of the Grail, the most ancient known Grail story (c. 1190) and large excerpts of Marcel Proust?s In Search of Lost Time, which I propose to read as a Grail quest, involving a young ignorant hero discovering the world and seeking something else than money, fame, and love (but also money, fame, and love). Through comparing a medieval and a modern text we will reflect on the passing of time, modernity and memory, reality and fiction, romance and novel. We will focus on the visual aspects of both stories, whose heroes share a contemplative/voyeuristic temper. The Tale of the Grail has generated an immense corpus of images from thirteenth-century illuminated manuscripts to the 1895 Edwin Austin Abbey wall paintings at the Boston Public Library and Grail films (1975 Monty Python Holy Grail, 1981 Raiders of the Lost Ark, etc.). In Search of Lost Time has been called a ?cathedral work,? that is, like a gothic cathedral, a space of eclectic visions. Real and fictional paintings illuminate the novel like a medieval manuscript. All members of the seminar will be invited to share their experiences of reading, viewing, and writing. Texts will be available in English and French. The seminar will follow the model of a quest: each class will be held in a different location (Harvard house, museum, garden, etc.) in the Boston area."
FRSEMR 60Z - Go Rococo! Techniques in Digital Design,FRSEMR 60Z , Go Rococo! Techniques in Digital Design,"Description:  At the beginning of the 18th century, baroque architecture and art in Western Europe entered a new phase called the Rococo, characterized by extreme visual complexity, ornamentation, and the collapse of compositional and political hierarchy. Architectural interiors became excessive (or at least no longer classically ordered) during this period, filled almost to the point of overflowing with painting, sculpture, and decoration, much of it depicting characters in mischievous and compromising postures. This seminar will examine the Rococo as a precedent for reflection on problems in contemporary design and as a provocation to create new work using digital design tools. Coursework will be founded on two related propositions: first, that the architecture and art of the Rococo are remarkably similar to the visual and material culture of the present day; and second, that contemporary design stands to benefit from a close examination of its predecessor. Activities will be divided between reading, writing, and making. Each week, students will examine a Rococo building precedent, reading the architecture against a series of texts on contemporary design issues. In addition, each student will undertake a semester?long design project using digital design tools to create and animate an architectural interior in the manner of the Rococo. Software tutorials on the Adobe Creative Cloud software suite will be provided in class. Readings and tutorials will be supplemented with field trips to the Houghton Library and Fogg Museum to experience Rococo artifacts first?hand."
FRSEMR 61H - Jefferson and Hamilton: Dueling American Visions,FRSEMR 61H , Jefferson and Hamilton: Dueling American Visions,"Description:  It is often said that the United States is a country based upon ideas, rather than blood ties. Shortly after the end of the American Revolution, and during the ratification of the Constitution, it became apparent that the people who had helped to make the Revolution differed about exactly what ideas would define America?s experiment in self-government. Two men, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, symbolized the conflicting visions that emerged once the revolutionaries began the business of running a new country. Jefferson was Secretary of State and Hamilton was Secretary of Treasury in Washington?s cabinet. They started cordially enough, but their contrasting views about politics and government quickly hardened into personal enmity. Much to President Washington?s chagrin, they battled in cabinet meetings and-- through surrogates and pseudonyms?in newspapers. Their clash helped create two-party politics in America, as each man attracted adherents to their respective visions of the future of the United States. Jefferson was the rural ?man of the people?, anti-British to his core, and supporter of the French Revolution. Hamilton was the urban friend of the elites in society, admirer of the British government, and opponent of the French Revolution. Their arguments about the true nature of American society continue today. This seminar will examine Jefferson and Hamilton as men, the way they fought their battle, and the nature of Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian visions. What did the men and their visions mean at the time, and what do they mean to us today?"
"FRSEMR 61J - No Fear, No Hate, No Pain? Questioning Identify and its Others in Modern Literature about Spain",FRSEMR 61J ," No Fear, No Hate, No Pain? Questioning Identify and its Others in Modern Literature about Spain","Description:  What?s the connection between fear, hate, pain and identity? To what extent are our personal and collective identities shaped by received ideas of ?others?? Does questioning ?others? help us understand our ideas of culture, nation, and polity? How do these questions help us understand our position in current political debates? What?s the value of asking these questions when we read modern literature about Spain? Najat El Hachmi will guide us in her turn-of-the-century journey of emancipation between Morocco and Barcelona. A journalist going by the same name as novelist Javier Cercas will rely on fiction to tell the truth of an anonymous hero of the Spanish Civil War. Juan Jose Saer, an Argentine writer living in France, will tell us an unsettling narrative of survival set in the 16th century about a 15-year-old cabin boy who was captured en route from Spain to the New World, and lived among cannibals for a decade. Carmen Laforet and Leopoldo Alas will spin tales of grit and self-reliance about a Catalan teenager and a Galician spinster in times of socio-political repression. Federico Garcia Lorca?s poems will show us a kaleidoscopic view of Depression-era New York. Among the aims of this seminar is to discuss how autobiography, fiction and poetry may challenge and entice readers to consent to or dissent from such representations. That is why this seminar also introduces students to different literary traditions while providing them with essential skills of literary analysis such as close reading and conceptual and historical framing."
FRSEMR 61K - Life Lessons from Professional Killers: What We Can Learn from the Samurai,FRSEMR 61K , Life Lessons from Professional Killers: What We Can Learn from the Samurai,"Description:  Is it possible to fail successfully? Should we be more beholden to the needs of others or to our own ambitions? Is there a set moral standard by which we should live our lives? What should we be prepared to sacrifice for higher goals?and what if pursuing those goals causes suffering to others? When should we take a risk? Is there such a thing as an ideal human being? Questions such as these have animated the figure of the samurai for nearly a millennium, captivating imaginations both in Japan and around the globe. What is it about this figure that speaks to some of our deepest questions about how to live a model human life? In this seminar, we will explore together the many meanings people have invested in the Japanese warrior, from medieval epics to kabuki plays, modern novels to propaganda, manga and anime to global cinematic blockbusters. (Tom Cruise, anyone?) Our focus will be less on the historical realities of the samurai than on the ways people have chosen to imagine them?and to what ends. In the process, we will consider what we ourselves might learn from this complex, fraught, appealing, and possibly dangerous figure. Our ?life lessons? from the samurai will include (among others), ?How to be a spectacular failure,? ?How to face the consequences of your actions,? ?How to justify your existence,? ?How to get revenge,? and ?How to make your brand go global.?"
FRSEMR 61L - ?Get Out of My Space!? Making Sense of Our Built Environment,FRSEMR 61L , ?Get Out of My Space!? Making Sense of Our Built Environment,"Description:  Today space is at a premium. We all want space, but what sort of space do we want? We have social space, virtual space, personal space, safe space, collective space. How much space is there? Can we run out of it? How much do you need when you tell me: ?Get out of my space!? What makes it ?yours?? How do we make space? Who controls it? Architecture helps us define space. We live, study, work and play in buildings and cities that have become the stages for our everyday lives, helping us do what we do and live our present. But architecture has another much more important function: It helps us imagine other possible ways of living. Architecture helps us envision the spaces we want to live in. In this seminar, we will explore the different ways in which we have created, claimed, fought over, shared and continue to imagine space. Our discussions will put a premium on the way architects, artists and social actors have produced space, and how their ideas and projects guide the way we understand our constructions of space. We will make space through hands-on projects such as mapping social networks and transforming your space through the technique of collage. These projects will challenge and help you record, transform and produce space. This seminar is designed to enrich your knowledge of space so that you may take a position on contemporary social questions, debate the nature of our built environment, and claim space for yourself."
FRSEMR 61P - Fighting Monsters: Gothic Fiction as Social Critique,FRSEMR 61P , Fighting Monsters: Gothic Fiction as Social Critique,"Description:  In this seminar we explore how Gothic fiction makes use of the figure of the monster to question social norms. What do vampires, zombies and cyborgs tell us about ourselves and our culture? We begin in the 18th-century, when Enlightened Europe witnessed an unprecedented vampire epidemic. Modern monsters such as the vampire entered the cultural stage at the same time as the core values that have defined Western democracies ever since were taking off: free will, free press, religious tolerance and human equality. What role did literary monsters play in the definition of these ideas? What role do they play today, when these freedoms are in jeopardy? Chasing various monster figures into the 21st century, we explore how their stories reflect the social conflicts of their time and ours. Texts from canonical American, British, French and German authors invite us to understand the perspective of those whom society excludes because they don?t fit its norms or they voice dissent. While we will encounter plenty of ?classic? monsters, we will investigate the roles of all kinds of societal ?others,? from madmen, trauma victims, and minorities, to death row inmates. Topics include: media revolutions, use and abuse of technological progress, revolution of sexuality, trauma theory, race, migration, prison politics, surveillance. Materials include film, visual arts, and the natural sciences. Excerpts from select texts by influential cultural theorists will help us to develop the analytical skills necessary to uncover the social critique hidden beneath Gothic fiction?s entertaining ?chill and thrill? surface."
FRSEMR 61Q - Language: The Origins of Meaning,FRSEMR 61Q , Language: The Origins of Meaning,"Description:  How do languages work? Why are they so distinctly human in the natural world? Is language a creation of our intelligence, i.e. we speak, because we are smart, or the other way around? Birds produce sophisticated songs. Do bird songs mean anything? They do, in some way. They serve, for example, as predator warnings or mating calls. Humans too, like birds, can produce music. But for effective day to day communication (or, say, to develop a scientific theory, etc.), we need languages with words and sentences, i.e. the kind of languages which is unique to our species. Do all languages, in spite of looking so diverse, share a common structure? For example, in English words fall into categories: cat is a noun, meow is a verb. Do all languages have nouns and verbs? A fairly recent turning point in addressing these fundamental questions has been to view language as a computational device. This is enabling us to build effective models of how languages are structured so as to empower us with the ability to create meaning; which, in turn, is shedding light, more and more, on who we are. The seminar will explore how natural languages come to create meaning and invite participants to develop their own linguistic analyses through modern logical and computational tools."
FRSEMR 61R - Shape Shifting Your Reality,FRSEMR 61R , Shape Shifting Your Reality,"Description:  This seminar investigates various forms of art making in order to answer one central question: how to process the experiences of daily life by expressing them in a work of art. The creative parts of the course will take place inside the sculpture studio of VES, but collecting the materials to use will happen outside it, as we gather ?found objects? at places like the Harvard Recycling Center, which will in turn offer us new perspectives on the use of materials in our everyday life at Harvard and beyond. On a field trip to New York City we will visit different locations where an artwork and its urban environment have influenced one another. The seminar includes a broad introduction to various methodologies of artistic creation, not only tangible but also intangible (e.g., sound recordings). Weekly practical and reading assignments are required. By end of the semester, we will present our works in an informal exhibition/intervention/happening."
"FRSEMR 61S - Baseball as Philosophy: God, Beauty, and Morality",FRSEMR 61S ," Baseball as Philosophy: God, Beauty, and Morality","Description:  Even seemingly commonplace features of the world offer us a route to inquiring into complex ideas and phenomena. You can think of this seminar as, in part, a sort of existence proof of that claim. Using baseball as a focusing lens, we will endeavor to cover a fairly large swath of philosophical terrain, including a more focused investigation of issues in ethics. We will consider, among other things, how baseball can help us understand: God?s relationship to morality; why a loving God would allow evil; indeterminate concepts; what makes something beautiful, or aesthetically valuable; social justice and income distributions; the moral permissibility of violating rules within a game; and the moral permissibility of biomedical enhancements to humans. Our investigation will put us in close contact with both contemporary scholarly writing on baseball, and canonical philosophical thinkers, starting with Plato. In addition to being the greatest game ever created, baseball offers surprisingly fertile ground for thinking about some of the deepest issues across philosophy."
FRSEMR 61U - Reading the Novella: Form and Suspense in Short Fiction,FRSEMR 61U , Reading the Novella: Form and Suspense in Short Fiction,"Description:  Short enough to read in a single sitting, but more complex and absorbing than short stories, novellas give us some of our most intense reading experiences. Indeed, many of the enduring classics of world literature, from Melville?s Benito Cereno to Tolstoy?s The Death of Ivan Ilich, take advantage of the novella's compression and acceleration of plot??features that are also suited to horror, mystery, and other forms of ?genre? fiction. In this seminar, we will read some of the great masters of the novella form, including Henry James, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Mann, Alice Munro, Katherine Anne Porter, and James Joyce, as well as other examples from around the world, including Eastern Europe, China, and Japan. Readings of 50-125 pages a week (all of it in English) will allow us to work closely with some classics of modern fiction, going down to the level of word choice and sentence structure, but we?ll also consider the way authors build and sustain suspense, the different forms of narrative resolution, and other questions of plotting and structure. We will also talk about how to get the most out of your weekly reading experiences?I?ll ask you to set aside solitary time for your reading each week and, as far as possible, to read each novella in just one or two sittings. You'll keep a reading journal, including 2-3 pages of unstructured writing each week; a number of short papers, including creative assignments, will help you understand the choices made by authors as they shape their stories for this most demanding and exciting of fictional forms."
FRSEMR 61W - This is the End of the World,FRSEMR 61W , This is the End of the World,"Description:  For millennia the end of the world has been feared, imagined, and exorcized by gifted writers, religious leaders, and intellectuals from the most diverse cultural backgrounds. Scholars have even suggested that ? over the last few decades ? such a worldview centered around an imminent end has become hegemonic by appearing in an almost endless number of very popular media stretching from blockbuster movies to comic books. This seminar will explore the cultural reasons behind this paradoxical attraction of humans towards fantasies detailing the end of the known world in catastrophic and often terrorizing colors. Imaginations of the end seem to have begun with the birth of the ?apocalypse? as a literary genre in ancient Judaism and Christianity. The seminar will follow some trajectories of these fantasies by comparing and contrasting exoteric ancient and medieval religious texts with modern and contemporary novels and movies. The ultimate goal will be to see how the rupture of social bonds, zombie or demonic attacks, and natural disasters are preferential occasions to reflect on the relationship of humans with nature, with the supernatural, and with each other. A few scholarly essays will be assigned, but the largest part of the course will be occupied by the direct reading, viewing, and discussion of primary materials (with the final opportunity to write your own tale of ?the end of the world?)."
FRSEMR 61X - Soft Power: The 21st Century Art Museum,FRSEMR 61X , Soft Power: The 21st Century Art Museum,"Description:  What are museums good for in the twenty-first century? Should they be temples of scholarship or purveyors of popular entertainment? Are they places in which we seek contemplative refuge in the experience of ?beauty,? or are they viable sites in which to work for social justice? Should we be investing public funds in museums, or are they a luxury best supported by private sources? To whom do museum collections ?belong?? Art museums today are thriving, yet they have never faced so many contentious questions about their role and responsibilities. Co-led by two curators at the Harvard Art Museums, this seminar will consider the big issues facing art museums across the globe today. The course is intended for both long-time museum goers, as well as those who have never set foot in an art gallery. We begin with a primer on museum basics?the work of collecting, conservation, display, and research?and an introduction to the many resources of the Harvard Art Museums. In the second half of the seminar, we consider the challenges that face both august, traditional institutions?like the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York?as well as younger, start-up museums like the private/ public collections being established across Asia."
"FRSEMR 62C - The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Russian Revolution Imagined, Documented, Advertised)",FRSEMR 62C ," The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Russian Revolution Imagined, Documented, Advertised)","Description:  Political change takes place in images and on screens as much as on the streets. Activists, artists and politicians have long understood that pictures speak to global audiences beyond spoken language. However images serve to expose and document as much as to mask and suppress other realities. This seminar examines the role images played in the Russian Revolution of 1917 in its attempts to fundamentally transform existing social order. The 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution in the fall of 2017 serves as an occasion to explore it as one of the first political uprisings in which modern media ? photography, poster art, moving images ? were used to imagine, document, represent and suppress revolutionary change.Even before 1917, Russian artists ignited revolutionary imagination in breaking with representational conventions and bringing new media into their creative work. The Soviet State subsequently adapted their representational strategies and new technologies. In 1918, the so-called Soviet agitation trains traveled to remote villages bringing documentary footage of the Russian Revolution to mostly illiterate peasant audiences, spreading the visual story of revolution before the coming of television. We will consider the legacy of the imaginings, transmissions and visual manipulations of history, looking at photography, visual art, documentary and feature film, folk art, children?s drawings, propaganda posters, and public spectacles and festivals. We will also read theoretical texts by artists, writers, filmmakers and politicians who imagined the new world and the role of visual art and new media in its transformation. What kind of social conditions made the new aesthetic choices relevant? Who is doing the depicting and what is and is not shown? What does it mean to visualize politics more broadly?"
FRSEMR 62D - Voyages: Extraordinary and Wondrous Journeys through This and Other Worlds,FRSEMR 62D , Voyages: Extraordinary and Wondrous Journeys through This and Other Worlds,"Description:  Together we will go on journeys over land, over sea, and into the deepest reaches of the human imagination. Great artistic works and big ideas will carry us through vast expanses of time and space. We will think about how the voyage is a fundamental aspect of the human condition, how travel to and through familiar, exotic, and otherworldly places raises basic questions about humanity, the possibilities of knowledge and imagining, and the interdisciplinary nature of our own minds. Our seminar will contemplate how people make sense of themselves, their histories, and the world around them. By contemplating voyage narratives of the commonplace and the fantastical, the visionary and the terrifying, the monstrous and the familiar, we will scrutinize how travel may occur in time, space, and speculative and supernatural worlds, and how some journeys happen as we sit still. The seminar encourages participants to cultivate their own curiosity as well as a capacious vision of the world, a culture of debate, and a love of ideas. We will see how stories of various kinds of journeys rest at the heart of the humanities on a truly global scale. A few questions that will guide our collective study of voyages are: what is the relationship between reason and passion? Between lived experience, story-telling, and self-reflection? How might we appreciate cultural difference without abandoning a notion of essential human values? Finally, the seminar seeks to open ways for students to enrich not only their future studies but also their lives."
FRSEMR 62G - The Rise and Fall of the Machine: Technology and Its Critics,FRSEMR 62G , The Rise and Fall of the Machine: Technology and Its Critics,"Description:  This freshman seminar investigates the history of six modern machines?the train, the camera, the radio, the mainframe computer, the personal computer, and the Internet?to trace shifting ideas about the relationship between technology and progress. Machines like these do a lot of things: they document the world; they advance scientific research; they make goods cheaper; they accelerate transportation and communication; they produce knowledge and diffuse information. Do they make the world a better place? Boosters and critics have debated this question since the Enlightenment. This hands-on seminar, in which we?ll grapple with the machines themselves, using Harvard?s Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments (CHSI) and the MIT Museum, asks students to wrestle with one of the most urgent and fundamental questions of the twenty-first century: What is the end of innovation? Students from all backgrounds are welcome, from engineers to artists. The chief work of the course is reading, listening, and watching: we?ll read essays, watch films, and listen to broadcasts. You?ll be asked to provide a response to each week?s materials before each seminar meeting. Another piece of work for this course is making: your final project will be either A) a machine of your own design (you could either build it or submit plans for it) or B) a product manufactured by a machine that we have studied (e.g., you could make a film or a podcast). Either way, you?ll also submit an essay, explaining how your machine or product makes the world a better place."
"FRSEMR 62H - Early 20th Century American and English Poetry: Love, War, Religion and Nature",FRSEMR 62H ," Early 20th Century American and English Poetry: Love, War, Religion and Nature","Description:  This seminar will focus on a few early 20th century poets, W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, Elizabeth Bishop, W. H. Auden, and a limited number of their most significant poems, ranging from their earliest verse to their latest. We will read the poetry in detail in order to understand not only its major themes but also its variety of tones, styles and structures. The hope will be to discover how each writer developed over the course of his or her career. The seminar will be run as a lively discussion intended to help us understand the extremely challenging as well as deeply rewarding verse that we will encounter. In the work of William Butler Yeats, we will trace, for example, major changes in his conception of love, as well as his complex views of Irish nationalism and the Irish revolution. Meanwhile, in T.S. Eliot, we encounter a narrator whose essential quest is spiritual in nature, beginning with Prufrock and then The Wasteland (which we will devote two weeks to.) Elizabeth Bishop introduces a highly original voice that expresses personal emotions obliquely and, in effect, ""objectively"" through understated descriptions of events and places. Finally, W.H. Auden's trajectory reveals an early (1930s) portrayal of human nature and society that is in certain respects similar to Eliot's but that ends very differently, suggesting values and modes of life that are far less foreboding. In the seminar's first week, we will read and analyze a small group of lyrics by Emily Dickenson and a few other writers (none of whom will be identified by name or exact time-period). This will be an exercise in ""close reading"" intended to help us judge poetic quality, because some of the lyrics will be excellent-and some quite dismal!"
"FRSEMR 62J - Harvard?s Greatest Hits: The Most Important, Rarest, and Most Valuable Books in Houghton Library",FRSEMR 62J ," Harvard?s Greatest Hits: The Most Important, Rarest, and Most Valuable Books in Houghton Library","Description:  Have you ever fantasized of turning the pages of a Gutenberg Bible with your own fingers? Then this seminar is for you. The Houghton Library of Harvard University is one of the world?s greatest repositories of ancient scrolls, papyrus codices, illuminated manuscripts on parchment and paper, early printed books, rare books published since the sixteenth century down until today, and stunning prints and other types of graphic art. In this freshman seminar, we will utilize Houghton?s extraordinary holdings to study first-hand the history of the book in the West as a material artifact from its beginnings in the ancient Near East down to the present day. Each week we will focus upon one or more books: a papyrus codex of Homer, a Torah scroll, a medieval illustrated Book of Hours, the Gutenberg Bible, the First Folio Edition of Shakespeare?s works, the King James Bible, Galileo?s Siderius Nuncius, and Alice in Wonderland, to name just a few of the works we will examine. During class-time, we will study the books again as a group. Visiting experts will demonstrate how to unroll a papyrus codex, the technology involved in printing on a hand-pulled press, and the techniques modern conservators use to preserve manuscripts and books. You will emerge from this seminar with a heightened understanding of what a rich thing a book is, so much more than just a text. And you will have seen and studied close-up some of the most visually spectacular and culturally significant books in all of Western history."
"FRSEMR 62K - Frankenstein: Two Hundred Years of Dr. Frankenstein?s Monster in Science and Culture, 1818?2018",FRSEMR 62K ," Frankenstein: Two Hundred Years of Dr. Frankenstein?s Monster in Science and Culture, 1818?2018","Description:  ?it lives!? Since his dull yellow eye first opened in the pages of Mary Shelley?s novel of 1818, Victor Frankenstein?s creature has occupied a key place in western culture. This year is the 200th anniversary of publication. Mary Shelley was only 19 when she first mapped out the monster?s story, and 21 when it was published. Our seminar aims to think seriously about the mingling of literature and science in this important creative work. We will read and analyze the novel together, cover Shelley?s life and times, consider some of the major interpretations that have been offered, especially thinking about the story as an alternative to traditional creation legends, and explore the history of science of her day. We will also engage with the movie tradition. Students will have an opportunity to research the continuing metaphor of Frankenstein in modern Franken-themes such as genetic engineering, test-tube babies, and GMOs."
FRSEMR 62L - Knowing Cicero,FRSEMR 62L , Knowing Cicero,"Description:  More than any other person from Greco-Roman antiquity, the Roman orator, politician, and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE) appears to be someone we can ?get to know.? Over eight hundred detailed, often highly personal, letters of his survive (most not intended for publication), as well as around a hundred from his correspondents, not to mention his fifty-odd extant speeches (most promoting a particular persona) and several self-portraits in his philosophical and rhetorical dialogues. Such a relative abundance of documentation, together with a fertile and complex afterlife in subsequent literature and culture, has led to a number of assumptions about Cicero?s ?character? or ?personality??the man behind so many eloquent words. Yet a quick look at past reactions reveals just how changeable posterity?s judgment of Cicero the man has been: ?Every one admires the Orator and the Consul; but for my Part, I esteem the Husband and the Father. His private Character, with all the little Weaknesses of Humanity, is as amiable, as the Figure he makes in publick is awful and majestic.? (Steele, 1710); ?the most unstable and timid of all Roman statesmen? (Mommsen, 1856); ?We may say then without discrediting Cicero, that he was not altogether fit for public life? (Boissier, 1897); ?a man of mild temper and of constitutional timidity, but of honest heart and sincere purpose? (Strachan-Davidson, 1900); ?no other antique personality has inspired such venomous dislike? (Shackleton Bailey 1971). This seminar offers an in-depth investigation of what it might mean to ?know Cicero? today, some two thousand years after he lived. After an introduction to ancient approaches to biography, it will use selections from the Letters alongside scholarly biographies to explore key phases of Cicero?s life in which the most fascinating and vivid glimpses of his personality are on offer. The last sessions will be devoted to contemporary representations of ?Cicero the man? in popular fiction and television. By getting to know Cicero we will consider what his compelling life has to teach us about self-presentation, persuasive speech, and the limits of biography."
FRSEMR 62O - Who is a Fascist? Culture and Politics on the Radical Right,FRSEMR 62O , Who is a Fascist? Culture and Politics on the Radical Right,"Description:  This seminar provides an in-depth introduction to fascism, its intellectual and political roots, its critique of liberal democracy and socialism, and the traces fascism has left on the contemporary cultural-political scene from Marine Le Pen?s Rassemblement National to the American alt-right to populist insurgencies like Trumpism. It begins with readings from key fascist thinkers and theorists, before surveying a series of domains where artists, writers, architects, film-makers, and engineers sought to interpret and embody the ?fascist revolution? not just in Italy but worldwide. Among the figures considered are mystical nationalists like Gabriele D?Annunzio; Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder and leader of the Futurist movement; the American poet Ezra Pound, author of the Cantos, one of the masterpieces of 20th century American poetry; Leni Riefenstahl, the film director of classic documentaries such as Olympia and Triumph of the Will; the architects Marcello Piacentini and Adolf Speer, the former Italy?s leading designer of public monuments and buildings during the Mussolini era, the latter Hitler?s preferred architect; and the engineer Gaetano Ciocca, creator of everything from Corporativist pig farms to mass-produced worker housing to mass sports stadia. Seminar themes will include: fascism vs. nazism; collectivism vs. individualism; radical right attitudes towards technology and industrialization; and examinations of the convergences and divergences between mid-20th century fascisms and the sub-cultures of today?s alt-right. The capstone project for the semester will involve an original research project focused on a contemporary alt-right group.This seminar provides an in-depth introduction to fascism, its intellectual and political roots, its critique of liberal democracy and socialism, and the traces fascism has left on the contemporary cultural-political scene from Marine Le Pen?s Rassemblement National to the American alt-right to populist insurgencies like Trumpism.

FRSEMR 62P - War in Fiction and Film,FRSEMR 62P , War in Fiction and Film,"Description:  War has been one of the most important subjects of art and literature from the beginning. Since the end of the draft in the United States in 1973, our knowledge of war and military service has become even more reliant upon media, and visual media in particular. The vast majority of students will not serve in the military. Yet few would doubt the contemporary influence of Catch 22, Slaughterhouse Five, Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and scores of other books and films. In this seminar, we will reflect on how these primarily fictional stories of war shape our understanding of culture, politics, and history. Several themes will occupy our seminar discussions. A persistent topic in the seminar will be aesthetic form: what impact do different kinds of stories have on our understanding of the experience of war? What are the commonalities between a war story and an ?anti-war? story? Similarly, how does the same story change when it is presented in a visual versus a verbal medium? How does the depiction of violence change across media? War stories frequently strive to convey the truth of the experience of battle, regardless of whether the story itself is fiction. Underlying the notion of a ?fictional truth? are various debates about authenticity and value. First-person narratives, for example, can be compelling precisely because they derive from harrowing individual experiences. We recognize that sometimes a war story serves to focus larger questions about individual agency and autonomy in hostile world."
FRSEMR 70H - Landmark Cases in American Constitutional History,FRSEMR 70H , Landmark Cases in American Constitutional History,"Description:  This freshman seminar will cover landmark Supreme Court decisions in American history: Marbury v. Madison (1803) (origins of judicial review); Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) (racial segregation in railroad transportation); Korematsu v. United States (1944) (Japanese-American internment); Brown v. Board of Education (1954) (school segregation); Brown II (1955) (Brown?s remedial order); Engel v. Vitale (1962) (school prayer); Reynolds v. Sims (1964) (legislative malapportionment); Miranda v. Arizona (1966) (right against self-incrimination); Furman v. Georgia (1972) (death penalty); Roe v. Wade (1973) (abortion); Bakke v. Board of Regents (1978) (affirmative action); and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) (gay marriage). Each session will discuss one case or one issue involving a couple of related cases. The seminar?s aim is to elucidate how the Supreme Court functions as a political institution?that is, to see how the Court?s decisions reflect the broader social and political context, and to consider the consequences of its rulings. The readings aim to present enough different angles from which to view the Court?s rulings to enable discussion of how a particular issue?such as the death penalty?became a topic of social controversy and of constitutional law, why Justices? opinions were written as they were, and an evaluation of the decision?s reasoning and its consequences. Readings for each session will average about two hours. In addition to discussing the readings, students will be required to write three papers reacting to the readings, each of about four or five pages. Students will be afforded some degree of choice in the weeks for which they write papers."
"FRSEMR 70K - Morality, Leadership, and Gray-Area Decisions",FRSEMR 70K ," Morality, Leadership, and Gray","Description:  Everyone with serious responsibilities, at work and throughout their lives, faces gray area decisions. In organizations, these highly uncertain, high-stakes decisions are delegated upward, to men and women in leadership positions. They have to make final decisions on these problems, despite the gray, and these decisions test their competence and their humanity. This seminar offers a variety of important perspectives on gray-area problems and on ways to resolve them, responsibly and effectively. The seminar begins by examining gray area problems in various professions and lines of work. Subsequent sessions focus on three different ways of resolving gray area problems ? in terms of accountability, character, and action. A typical session of the seminar will draw upon classic works of fiction, basic ideas in moral philosophy, and contemporary situations. These situations are typically described in short case studies involving men and women early in their careers, and they give students in the seminar the opportunity to grapple with these problems in personal terms ? by discussing what they would do in these situations. From time to time, students will write short papers, which will be discussed in the seminar."
"FRSEMR 70L - Ancient East Asia: Contested Archaeologies of China, Korea and Japan",FRSEMR 70L ," Ancient East Asia: Contested Archaeologies of China, Korea and Japan","Description:  How is our understanding of the past determined or framed by the concerns of the present? This course considers this problem with a focus on East Asia. In the process, we learn about the origins of the people, cultures, and civilizations of East Asia, but we don?t focus simply on the apparent facts of historic reconstruction, but instead consider how the varied and complicated histories and relationships among people and societies in the modern Nation?States of China, Korea, Japan and other nearby countries are understood through archaeological practice in the present. This class explores those origins, and focuses on controversies that show the stakes of archaeological interpretation to political and social discourse in the modern world. We will discuss fundamental questions in the prehistory and early history of East Asia through the lens of archaeological discoveries, including human origins, the origins of agriculture, how stratified, complex societies emerged, early processes of globalization and connections across Eurasia, conflicts between centers and peripheries, connections between China, Korea and Japan in prehistory, Buddhist origins, and more. How are the ?origins? in these modern countries similar or different? How are they related? Are they controversial? We will explore controversies that have emerged in recent East Asian archaeological research and discuss why archaeological topics are subject to controversial interpretation and what is at stake in the disagreements. These examples illustrate the significance of ancient cultural material in the modern world and what is at stake in debates over who owns the past. Why should we, situated at Harvard, care about the Asian past? How is this connected to modern Asian identity, and does this relate to Asian?American identity? Course participants will produce a digital exhibit that will engage in the reflective production of knowledge about Ancient East Asia by examining some aspect of the archaeological record of the East Asian past."
FRSEMR 70Q - Keeping It Simple: Consumer Financial Protection in a Complex World,FRSEMR 70Q , Keeping It Simple: Consumer Financial Protection in a Complex World,"Description:  People face a daunting array of problems in managing their financial lives. Taking out student loans, managing bank accounts and credit cards, financing a home purchase with a mortgage, and saving for retirement are all major challenges. There is evidence that many people lack the skills they need to meet these challenges. This seminar has three goals. The first objective is to give participants a basic grounding in financial literacy: principles of finance that we can use in our own lives. The second objective is to introduce research on the ways in which households use the financial system, emphasizing common financial mistakes and financial products that seem prone to misuse. We will learn to read papers from the academic economics literature, focusing on the papers? central ideas and empirical findings. The third objective is to explore ways in which the financial system can be improved to make it easier and safer to use. We will discuss the role of financial advisers, technological solutions (?fintech?), and public policy interventions including required disclosures, default choices (?nudges?), and regulations restricting access to financial products. We will monitor developments at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other government agencies involved in consumer financial regulation."
FRSEMR 70R - Beachhead for Radicalism or Bastion of the Elite Establishment? American Higher Education,FRSEMR 70R , Beachhead for Radicalism or Bastion of the Elite Establishment? American Higher Education,"Description:  When colleges and universities are in the news, it?s often related to politics. Headlines feature students who shout down controversial speakers or professors who only present liberal ideas in their classrooms or universities that fire professors whose tweets anger donors. The public is interested in these stories because the stakes are high. Colleges and universities teach the people who are going to be the next generation of leaders. What if those people are indoctrinated with bad ideas or are not taught to how to behave in democracy? Faculty members are the country?s experts. What if they do not provide reliable information? As experts should their views count more those of average citizens? Colleges and universities are supported with tax dollars and private donations and tuition payments. Who are they accountable to? The debate about higher education and politics polarizes quickly. Conservatives accuse higher education of radicalism and progressives accuse it of supporting the elite power structure. But the reality is more complex. We will explore the complexity of universities? relation to politics by studying historical periods of intense political conflict, such as times of war or periods of political activism, such as the abolitionist movement or the civil rights movement. These historical cases will help us think more clearly about the present, another period of political strife effecting American higher education. In addition to examining how these political conflicts intersected with higher education nationally, we will conduct original research on their impact at Harvard. The class will meet in the Harvard University Archives where we will have access to a wealth of primary sources including students? diaries, course materials, administrative records, professors? correspondence and materials produced by student organizations. Every week we will delve into sources related to topic under consideration and over the course of the semester, students will undertake increasingly complex research projects of their own design."
FRSEMR 70V - Law at Work: Employment Rights in the Age of Uber,FRSEMR 70V , Law at Work: Employment Rights in the Age of Uber,"Description:  Work is what most of us do with most of our time. Even before we start a career, we invest our energy in preparing for work and in imagining what work life will be. In this seminar, we explore the multiple ways that law defines what work is like in the contemporary United States. We start with the question of how much power an employer should have over employee: should it really be legal to fire someone for wearing the wrong tie or having the wrong spouse? We then debate the issue of appearance codes, asking whether an employer should be able to require women to wear makeup or to ban employees from having dreadlocks. We will explore the ways in which sexual orientation, gender identity, and immigration status impact employees? rights at work. And we will ask whether it ever should be legal for an employer to hire employees of only one gender: should Hooters Restaurant, for example, be permitted to hire only women as waiters or should those jobs be equally available to men? The seminar also will examine the way law polices the line between work and ?life? by looking at the emerging right-to-disconnect. And the seminar will address the fundamental question of who exactly is an employee: do Uber drivers or college football players count? The seminar concludes with a discussion of the ways technological changes are transforming work and, with it, the law that governs this central feature of our lives."
FRSEMR 70X - Decision Theory and Game Theory in the Real World,FRSEMR 70X , Decision Theory and Game Theory in the Real World,"Description:  The goal of this seminar is to provide students with building blocks for understanding how to make better decisions. Decision theory, which focuses on how to assess uncertainties and to define preferences across outcomes, is explicitly prescriptive, i.e., explaining what one should do. Game theory engages more complex situations where the choices of other individuals come into play. Nevertheless, acquaintance with the central tools of gam theory should enable students to behave more effectively in interactive situations. It should also help them structure interactive situations in ways that produce collectively superior results.The seminar will present some technical material from these two disciplines, but seminar meetings will focus on discussion and applications of those technical results. The only mathematical prerequisite is high school algebra and some knowledge of elementary statistics. However, conceptual thinking will be stressed."
FRSEMR 70Y - Asian America,FRSEMR 70Y , Asian America,"Description:  How ""Asian"" is America today? This seminar explores the Asian dimensions of American history, immigration, religion, and culture from the first encounters of Thoreau and Emerson with texts and ideas of the ""Orient"" to the saturation of modern America with the holistic cultures of yoga, tai chi, and mind-body medicine. We will also look at the Asian communities from India, China, Korea, and Japan that brought new forms of religious and cultural life to the U.S. in the 20th century."
"FRSEMR 70Z - Regulating Online Conduct: Speech, Privacy, and the Use and Sharing of Content",FRSEMR 70Z ," Regulating Online Conduct: Speech, Privacy, and the Use and Sharing of Content","Description:  In the course of a few short decades, the Internet has become integral to significant swaths of human experience. It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and exploitation of content. Mass-scale online distribution of copyrighted works tests the limits of legal doctrines developed in an era of physical copies. Age-old tensions between privacy and the right to free expression have been exacerbated in cases where one?s right to speak bumps up against the desire of another to keep information private. And, the ability to share?and, thus, to consume?extraordinary amounts of personal data has impacted government (which collects and uses data for purposes of law enforcement) and private companies (which collect and use data for purposes of advertising and monetization). This seminar will provide an overview of legal doctrines that govern the online conduct of individuals and institutional actors. It will address the rights and responsibilities of the intermediaries that mediate many of our online activities ? social networks, cloud-based storage services, email providers, and the like. Students will consider old and new legal frameworks and the ways in which the law informs strategic decisions for those that operate online. The seminar will address some of the most important and complex policy debates of our day?regarding the proper scope of intellectual property protection; the balance between a robust environment for online free expression and a desire to protect against harmful speech; and the ways in which the law addresses privacy vis-a-vis both government and private actors. Readings and in-class conversations will cover legal cases and case studies, offering students a high-level view of the technical, legal, and business landscape and allowing them to delve deeply into particularly difficult sets of problems concerning the regulation of online conduct."
FRSEMR 71D - Zen and the Art of Living: Making the Ordinary Extraordinary,FRSEMR 71D , Zen and the Art of Living: Making the Ordinary Extraordinary,"Description:  This seminar explores the rich history, philosophy and practices of Zen Buddhism as it developed in China, Korea, and Japan. We will first consider the emergence of the Zen tradition out of the Buddhist tradition and then explore the full range of its most distinctive features (Zen monastic meditation), cultural practices (painting, calligraphy, and poetry), and radical?even iconoclastic?innovations (such as the use of k?ans, which are seemingly nonsensical sayings that defy rationality). We will also critically evaluate some less well-known facets of the Zen tradition, such as gender issues, the veneration of mummified masters, and the question of how Zen was implicated in modern nationalistic movements in Japan during World War II. During the mid-20th century, Zen became a global phenomenon as Zen masters began to move around the world and introduce the practice of Zen meditation to those in search of religious alternatives to Western organized religions, rationalism, and materialism. Zen attracted the attention of writers, musicians, artists, and athletes. Why did Zen develop such a trans-cultural appeal at that moment in history? Why are there so many books with the title: ?Zen and the Art of?..?? Why do so many computer and tech companies have Zen in their names? How has Zen meditation fed into the current ?meditation/mindfulness? boom? These are some of the questions we will explore in this seminar through readings, film screenings, museum viewings, and a visit to a Zen meditation center."
"FRSEMR 71E - Discovering Cultures and the Sea: Navigation, Exploration, Conquest, and Trade",FRSEMR 71E ," Discovering Cultures and the Sea: Navigation, Exploration, Conquest, and Trade","Description:  Oceans separate distant places, but throughout history societies have looked across the seas for ways to make faraway connections. This seminar will examine many ways that cultures around the world have been shaped by maritime matters. Navigation, Vikings and Basques in North America, the spice trade, Spanish galleons, slavery, New England?s clipper trade with Asia, Maine lobstermen, naval warfare, and contemporary overfishing are all parts of the story. Two short essays and a term project (approximately 12 pages), as well as in-class individual and group presentations."
FRSEMR 71F - The Origins of the Human Mind,FRSEMR 71F , The Origins of the Human Mind,"Description:  The adult human mind is a unique phenomenon on earth. Only people can ponder the causes of and cures for global warming or pancreatic cancer, and can think thoughts about molecules, genes, democracy? Animals, and human infants, do not have most of the 500,000 concepts expressed by words in English. How does the human mind work, and how can we understand how it came to be, with its vast repertoire of concepts from which we routinely compose thoughts? In this seminar, we will explore together the origins and development of human knowledge in the individual child, in relation to two larger time scales: biological evolution and historical/cultural development. We will begin with several case studies, including case studies of the origin of the concepts natural number and living being. Each case study illustrates how all of the disciplines within the cognitive sciences, as well as anthropological, archeological and historical disciplines, shed light on these issues. The main focus will be on experimental work from psychology. We will then turn to case studies chosen by the participants in the seminar. By the end, seminar students will have a grasp of the theoretical debates about the nature of the human mind that have animated philosophy since the time of the Greek philosophers, as well as why considerations of the origins of the mind were always seen as central to these debates. Students taking this seminar should have an interest in learning about the cognitive sciences, which draw primarily from linguistics, analytic philosophy, computer science, and experimental psychology."
FRSEMR 71G - Americans at Work in the Age of Robots and Artificial Intelligence,FRSEMR 71G , Americans at Work in the Age of Robots and Artificial Intelligence,"Description:  Where will the coming generation of Americans (say, today?s 18-year-olds) find jobs? And will the jobs be worth having? People have worried about losing their jobs to technology at least since the Luddites 200 years ago. In the aggregate, they have been wrong. The automobile put lots of stable boys and saddle makers out of work, but it created vastly more jobs making cars, and fueling them and repairing them, and it opened the way for whole new industries like roadside motels and restaurants. With robots increasingly performing the tasks once done by blue-collar labor, however, and computers and artificial intelligence now eliminating the need for many workers once thought to be immune because of their cognitive skills, today?s technological threat seems different. It is no longer just the unskilled and undereducated whose jobs are at risk. Moreover, the challenge may be especially acute in America, where wages are far higher than in many other countries and an ever greater share of what we consume and invest not only can be provided from overseas but often is. Does the next generation of Americans, then, face a genuine threat from advancing workplace technology? If so, what are the dangers ? not just economic, but social, political, even moral ? to the country as a whole? Most important, what can we do about it?"
FRSEMR 71H - Political Philosophy in Swift?s Gulliver?s Travels,FRSEMR 71H , Political Philosophy in Swift?s Gulliver?s Travels,"Description:  Jonathan Swift was a great writer and one of the funniest men who ever lived. But he was also a great thinker, as this seminar proposes to show. His comedy leads him to the baser side of human life and to flagrant indecencies about shameful things. Why are humans ashamed of themselves? Why do they need to have their dignity recognized? Another aspect of Gulliver?s Travels is its politics. Gulliver visits four imaginary regimes and compares them?a study of comparative government. What is the best regime, and why is Gulliver dissatisfied wherever he goes? In one of the regimes is an academy of scientific researchers, mocked by Swift. How can modern science reconcile its materialism with the dignity of humans? What is the compatibility of science and the humanities? To these three themes of the seminar, all of them still timely for us, one must add a view of Swift?s matchless satire and irony. Is his comic imagination mere idiosyncratic exaggeration, or is there truth in it?"
FRSEMR 71J - Power Shifts: Understanding Global Change through History,FRSEMR 71J , Power Shifts: Understanding Global Change through History,"Description:  Nobody can understand the present without a keen understanding of the past. Even though the study of history has value in itself, it is also something that can help us make sense of today?s world. Successful people often understand this and turn a view of the past to their advantage in interpreting the present. They understand how any good plan is grounded in a sound view of history. This seminar will discuss major shifts in history from European and Asian antiquity up to today. It looks at power in all its dimensions?material, demographic, technological, ideological, military, or religious?and shows how it has influenced and been influenced by major transformations in global history. Our aim is to discuss the key causes of power shifts, but also to get an impression of the fickleness of established orders in times of tectonic change. The class reading will center on a number of brief historical cases developed at the Harvard Kennedy School. They range from ancient Greece, China, and Arabia up to the Iraq war and US-China relations today. Through these cases we want to discuss dimensions of power and how they shift over time. We also want to look at how leaders have initiated, steered, or responded to power shifts. The purpose of the cases is to illuminate how people in the past have reacted to major change and how their choices may help us understand the tools and options that are at our disposal when making critical decisions."
FRSEMR 71L - Can Democracy be Saved?,FRSEMR 71L , Can Democracy be Saved?,"Description:  Around the globe, democracy is increasingly embattled. From Hungary, Venezuela and Turkey to Western Europe and the United Sates, there is growing perception that democracy itself faces a series of unprecedented challenges. Norm-breaking insurgents confront declining mainstream parties. Once in power, elected leaders with authoritarian inclinations often entrench themselves in power. Voters seem increasingly susceptible to ?fake news.? Economic inequality makes democracy vulnerable to ?capture? by powerful economic interests. And intense party polarization sometimes leaves voters blind to abuses of elected autocrats. Can democracy be saved? This seminar explores the concept of democracy and some chronic problems in the practice of democracy to trace the history of the idea, exploring whether the supposedly self-correctly logic of democracy is broken today. We explore how voters and political parties are thought to behave according to democratic theory. And we then explore how the three challenges of ?fake news,? ?economic inequality,? and ?polarization,? may make democracy more fragile than it has been in the past. We explore significant historical and contemporary cases of democratic breakdown to try discern lessons for our own democracy as it confronts these challenges."
FRSEMR 71N - The Causes and Consequences of Inequality,FRSEMR 71N , The Causes and Consequences of Inequality,"Description:  Sickness and death are universal human experiences. Yet we are often uncomfortable talking and thinking about them in relation to ourselves, and to those whom we love. The core thesis of this seminar is that exploring these human vulnerabilities is a way of learning to live a more meaningful life, strengthening relationships, and helping us be better caretakers of people we love, and of people whom we serve in a professional role. In this seminar, we propose to examine, from multiple perspectives, the social, cultural, psychological, economic, and spiritual factors that influence the experience of serious illness. The seminar will draw on core readings from the humanities, social sciences, and medicine to deepen understandings of how people experience and live and die with a serious illness. Opportunities for discussion, reflection, live interviews, case analysis, and experiential exercises will take place in class; additional field learning opportunities (e.g., home visits, participation in hospital-based teaching rounds) will also be available outside of class."

GHHP 40 - Everyone Needs A Health System: A Global View,GHHP 40 , Everyone Needs A Health System: A Global View,"Description:  The 20th century saw a revolution in health care which profoundly transformed human survival and well-being throughout the world. This revolution of progress is continuing today and bringing with it new challenges. This success of human endeavor resulted in creation of modern health systems in every country. These systems are an increasing important part of national economies, accounting for a few percent of GDP in some low-income countries to 18% in the USA. They often play a key role in national politics and the perceived welfare of citizens. What can we learn from these developments to do better in the future?This course is a foundational introduction to the development of national health systems with a global perspective encompassing countries at all levels of income. The course will address five key questions students need to be able to answer about health systems with a global view. These are: (1) What is a health system and why does its development matter; (2) Why are health systems in different countries so different; (3) How do health systems work to produce the results they do; (4) How can action make health systems better; (5) How are disruptors changing health systems globally?"

Rather than focusing on how to address the aftermath of conflict and violence, this course examines theory and practical methods to prevent destructive conflict. We explore conceptual frameworks from which to negotiate its substantive, emotional, and identity-based dimensions, and students apply these methods to real-life dilemmas, ranging from interpersonal disputes between friends to international conflict in the Middle East and elsewhere. This highly interactive course aims to improve students' understanding of conflict and their skill in resolving it, drawing on a variety of learning methodologies including interactive lectures, case simulations, analysis of real-life conflicts, and self-reflection exercises."

HAA 17V - Introduction to Modern Architectures,HAA 17V , Introduction to Modern Architectures,"Description:  This undergraduate survey course traces developments in architecture from the late nineteenth-century to the twentieth and beyond. We will focus on the consolidation of modernism as a global phenomenon in the 20th Century, engaging projects and architects who had a direct hand in its shaping and those who opposed it. We will look at key works of architecture and urban planning as laboratories of modernity fraught with tensions between tradition and innovation, form and function, art and technology, creative genius and teamwork, nationalism and internationalism. As modern architecture developed throughout the world, architects, planners and designers refashioned the built environment to serve the needs of growing populations, emerging nations, political ideologies, international markets and industrial modernization. The course will present how architects aimed to fulfill the promises of industrial modernity and need to be 'modern.' We will focus on case studies in the Americas and the Europes that launched global debates and international actors. The course highlights a simultaneous modernity and a dynamic international architecture culture that prepared the grounds for contemporary globalization."

HAA 270W - Historiography of Modern Architecture: In Search for a Global History,HAA 270W , Historiography of Modern Architecture: In Search for a Global History,"Description:  This graduate seminar traces the development of architectural modernism as a discursive practice. It explores the construction of a cohesive narrative that enabled modernism to become the hegemonic embodiment of modernity in the mid-20th Century and led to its critique in the 1960s and beyond. We will interrogate foundational texts by architectural historians?such as Hitchcock, Giedion, Benevolo and Tafuri and Dal Co?and address the challenges to these histories with the development of modernism beyond Europe and the United States. We will focus on 'other' modernisms as sites of enunciations, both formal and discursive, that will challenge these foundational histories. The aim is to gain a greater understanding of modern architecture as a global endeavor, as well as to examine architecture history as an operative and critical practice. In examining the historiography of modernism, the course aims to address contemporary historiographic critiques and explore the present need of a global history of architecture."

Having analyzed the fundamental role of primitivism, tradition, mass culture, and the commodity form in Cubism's genesis, our major endeavor is to unpack its ever-shifting relation to its aesthetic Others, namely, abstraction, decoration, the ready-made, realism, and monumentalism. Crucial to this endeavor is a thorough examination of the problem of medium in Cubism, considering not only drawing, easel painting, collage, and constructed sculpture, but also mural painting, architecture, photography, and film."
"HAA 277Y - From Posada to Isotype: International Progressive Political Print Culture, 1900-1945",HAA 277Y ," From Posada to Isotype: International Progressive Political Print Culture, 1900","Description:  This seminar, open to Graduates and qualified undergraduates will trace the developments and exchanges between presumably regressive and anti-technological media such as the woodcut and the linocuts in the first half of the twentieth century, in its various geo-political contexts from Mexico and Germany to the Soviet Union and China. Key figures to be studied will be Kathe Kollwitz and some of the German Expressionists, Jose Posada, Leopoldo Mendez, Elizabeth Catlett and the Taller de Grafica Popular, Frans Masereel, Gerd Arntz and Otto Neurath. The debates around and against photography and technological media will be one of the theoretical challenges of the seminar, and the internationalization and interactions through major critics and historians travelling to the Soviet Union and subsequently in exile in Mexico, such as Hannes Meyer , Paul Westheim and Anna Seghers will form its historical horizons."

Thesis students will be responsible for selecting a Thesis Advisor (or Advisors) with whom they will meet regularly to develop specific intention, substance and methodology of the thesis research and paper. This seminar is a support of independent thesis and/or independent project research, extending methodological inquiry of the project topic to design where students may convene to collectively discuss and experiment with design speculations ? design tests that explore research through the visual and spatial language of architecture. The course will cover topics general to design research with discussions, assignments, and readings focused on three main themes in relation to architectural design: Discourse, the development of a proposition for the roleand significance of architecture relative to the project topic of interest; Method, the design steps/process of working through a design application/inquiry of those ideas; and Context, the relationship of the project topic of study to broader surroundings which include but are not limited to the discipline of architecture, cultural contexts,technical developments and/or typologies. The seminar will emphasize and support the translation of ideas emerging from independent research into visual forms of representation including, but not limited to, drawings, diagrams, images, study models, and shortanimations. The techniques of representation reviewed will be catered to the project topics of individual students, but will also form a part of the general discussion of the course.HAA 96A Transformations or HAA 96B Connections design studios is a pre?requisite to the Design Speculations course."

HEB 1480 - Building the Human Body,HEB 1480 , Building the Human Body,"Description:  Humans and our primate relatives display marked variation in biological traits. This variation results from natural selection operating on pre- and post-natal developmental mechanisms. While these mechanisms remain mostly unknown, recent advances in genetics, genomics, and developmental biology now allow us to begin to understand how evolutionary processes influence and are influenced by underlying developmental and genetic organization. This course explores these inter-relationships in the context of the primate paleontological record. We focus on the evolution of the post-cranial skeleton (i.e., the axial skeleton, girdles, and limbs) and craniofacial skeletons, and present studies that cast light on the mechanisms that underlie major transitions in human evolution."
HEB 1600 - Evolutionary Genetics of Complex Human Traits,HEB 1600 , Evolutionary Genetics of Complex Human Traits,"Description:  An advanced seminar on complex human traits with a special focus on neurodevelopmental and other behavioral disorders. Topics will include schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and Williams syndrome; links between genotype and phenotype; whether natural selection acts on underlying genetic loci; the role of gene-by-environment interactions; what we can learn about humans from model organisms; complicating factors in the analysis of complex traits; societal reactions to neural diversity; and prospects for the reconstruction of past human behavior from genomic evidence."

HIST 60O - American Indian History in Four Acts,HIST 60O , American Indian History in Four Acts,"Description:  Both scholars and tribal people (not mutually exclusive!) have found it useful to structure American Indian history around four broad chronological categories emerging from the formation of United States Indian policy: Treatymaking, Indian Removal, Land Allotment, and Self-Determination. This seminar will use this ""four acts"" structure to offer a broad overview of American Indian history, while also considering the limitations of such category-making, including the decentering of Indian people and the blunting of historical complexity. Engaged with primary sources and historiography, the course will also allow students to engage in original research in the field of American Indian history."
"HIST 70J - Byzantium between the Crusades and the Islamic World, c.1100-c.1450",HIST 70J ," Byzantium between the Crusades and the Islamic World, c.1100","Description:  The seminar focuses on the eastern Mediterranean in a period of economic integration and political fragmentation marked by the crusades, the expansion of the Italian maritime republics, western colonization, and the conquests of the Turks. How did the Byzantines react to the new unsettled world around them? What was the role of the newcomers? Special attention will be paid to the crusades, cross-cultural contacts, and the Mediterranean economy."
HIST 74N - U.S. History: Major Themes in the Twentieth Century,HIST 74N , U.S. History: Major Themes in the Twentieth Century,"Description:  The twentieth-century United States is a vibrant and flourishing field of historical study. The goal of this seminar is to introduce students to the central questions, problems and debates in the history of the ""American century."" Students will learn how the literature of history has developed through reading both older and newer approaches. Readings focus on questions of politics, political culture, the state and social life. The course is both thematic and chronological (as well as necessarily selective). Students are expected to prepare well for seminar and to participate actively in discussion. Each class will begin with a brief introduction to the readings (no more than five minutes) by a member of the seminar. The idea here is for one student to take special responsibility for leading discussion, raising questions and problems posed by the reading."
HIST 84G - Harvard and Slavery,HIST 84G , Harvard and Slavery,"Description:  Will explore the links between Harvard and slavery during the first 229 years of the university's history. Students will write original research papers on various aspects of the history of Harvard University and slavery, including how resources extracted from slave labor benefited the university, the ways Harvard administrators and faculty supported or struggled against the institution of slavery, and what kinds of links the university built to slaveholders."
HIST 88B - Medieval History and Cinema,HIST 88B , Medieval History and Cinema,"Description:  This course deals with the challenges of representing medieval history by focusing on selected films, which will be viewed at two levels at once, as films and as history. What are the uses of cinema as a vehicle for thinking about the past? What qualities, other than accuracy, make for good history in films? What are the advantages, if any, of cinematic representation of the premodern past with its different sense of intimacy with the supernatural?"
HIST 91R - Supervised Reading and Research,HIST 91R , Supervised Reading and Research,"Description:  Limited to juniors and seniors.

HIST 99A - Senior Thesis Tutorial,HIST 99A , Senior Thesis Tutorial,Description:  Researching and writing the senior thesis in History. Part one of a two-part series.
HIST-LIT 90BA - England After Empire,HIST,LIT 90BA ,"Description:  This course considers the way England was transformed through the demise of its Empire after the Second World War through to the present day. From the birth of the welfare state to the rise of Thatcherism, from post-colonial migration to multicultural Britain, from the Swinging Sixties to punk rock and riots, we will track these radical political, social and cultural changes through novels, poetry, theater, film, pop music, photography, fashion, food and sport. We will explore the way Britain sought to retain its influence in the world, through its involvement in the Cold War, its relations with the Commonwealth, and its continuing `special relationship? with the United States, even as what being English or British began to change in meaning. As well as reading literary works by Philip Larkin, Jean Rhys, JG Ballard, Salman Rushdie, China Mieville, and Zadie Smith, we will consider the nation?s popular culture, from The Beatles to The Sex Pistols, from James Bond to J.K. Rowling."
HIST-LIT 90BY - Cold War Cinema,HIST,LIT 90BY ,"Description:  This course examines the history of the United States and the Cold War using popular films made during the conflict as the principal texts. The class is divided into two units -- the first looks at the effects of the ""Red Scare"" on culture and politics in the United States from the 1940s to the mid-1960s. The second section examines U.S. interventions in the ""Third World"" from the 1950s to the 1980s and their influences both on countries from Algeria to Afghanistan and domestically."
HIST-LIT 90CT - Deportation and the Policing of Migration in U.S. History,HIST,LIT 90CT ,"Description:  This course examines the history of deportation in American society, and considers how the policing, exclusion, and expulsion of immigrant populations has shaped the nation. Through historical texts, primary sources, literature, and popular culture, we will cover a wide range of topics including racial quotas, guestworker expulsions, labor control, racialized health panics, national security scares, the disproportionate removal of black immigrants, the growth of immigrant detention, the criminalization of immigrant communities, and immigrant rights activism. Although mass deportation is often understood as a recent phenomenon, this course will demonstrate the ways that immigration control stretches as far back as creation of the United States. We will trace shifting opinions about immigration, the meaning of citizenship, statelessness, and national belonging."
HIST-LIT 90CU - Fashion and Slavery,HIST,LIT 90CU ,"Description:  This course examines the politics of fashion among people of African descent during slavery and the period immediately followed emancipation. Fashion is generative, yet underutilized analytic to explore the experience of the enslaved and their descendants. Geographical breadth is crucial to examining the African Diaspora in its full complexity; therefore, course material will cover the United States, Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa. We will examine in particular the relationship between slave consumerism and the development of modern capitalism in the Atlantic World. Other topics of the course will include: sumptuary law, wealth accumulation among the enslaved and formally enslaved, honor and respectability politics, commodification of the enslaved, gendered sartorial expression, etc."
HIST-LIT 90CV - Contemporary American Literature and Popular Music,HIST,LIT 90CV ,"Description:  This class examines the relationship between popular music, American literature, and the power structures that organize life in the United States. We will study the ways that music constructs social identities by considering how popular music?in performance, on record, and in written representation?can both reinforce and challenge hierarchies of gender, race, region, sexuality, class, and citizenship. Listening to recording artists such as Johnny Cash, Frank Ocean, Beyonce, and Kendrick Lamar, we will learn how music plays a critical role in producing the social distinctions that popular culture is often presumed simply to reflect. Moreover, our study of literature by Alice Walker, Mary Gaitskill, Essex Hemphill, and others will show how the literary representation of sound can both articulate the pleasures and resist the injustices of an often-inadequate present moment. As part of this course, you will learn to design, record, and produce your own podcast episodes."
HIST-LIT 90CX - Stop Making Sense: America in the 1980s,HIST,LIT 90CX ,"Description:  The 1980s saw the convergence of American politics and economics to strengthen US interests abroad, but the decade was also a moment of enormous social, political, and economic divergence at home. How compatible?or causal?was the end of the cold war with the end of the American cultural consensus? Did such a consensus ever exist, or was it a mere illusion and nostalgia for a ?simpler time?? Three decades later, these questions remain essential to understanding the history surrounding the cold war and the culture wars. This course will look at how culture--including novels, films, plays, music, and more--both shapes and is shaped by social and political attitudes. As the 1980s experiences a pop culture comeback in the 2010s, how do we begin to critically make sense of a decade of contradictions?"
"HIST-LIT 90CY - Watergate: Conspiracy, Paranoia, and the Abuse of Power",HIST,LIT 90CY ,"Description:  Russiagate, Emailgate, Benghazigate: these are the latest in a series of scandals and pseudo-scandals bearing the suffix that originates in the name of the Washington hotel where, in the summer of 1972, burglars associated with the Committee to Re-Elect the President (sometimes abbreviated as ?CREEP?) broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The subsequent cover-up and revelations of a myriad of crimes and abuses of power by the Nixon White House and previous administrations, abbreviated as ?Watergate,? reshaped U.S. political culture in the 1970s and resonate into our own time. In this course, we will explore how Watergate figured into canonical works of popular culture, especially Hollywood movies, in the first half of the 1970s. Corrupt power, secrecy, surveillance, and paranoia suffuse these works. They speak to a pervasive distrust of American institutions?especially government?that extended across the political spectrum. Watergate will be our entry point into a wide-ranging engagement with the cultural history of the 1970s and its legacies in the present. Filmmakers and authors include Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet, Barbara Kopple, Alan J. Pakula, Ivan Dixon, Robert Altman, Roman Polanski, Martin Scorsese, Mary McCarthy, Elizabeth Drew, Kurt Vonnegut, Ursula K. LeGuin, Gore Vidal, Carl Bernstein, and Bob Woodward."
HIST-LIT 90DB - Museums in America,HIST,LIT 90DB ,"Description:  In this course, we will consider the literary and cultural history of American museums from the eighteenth century to the present. Throughout the semester, we will discuss how museums have functioned as both centers for research and as public spaces for education and entertainment, and how such priorities have evolved over the past few centuries, shaped by new ideas about conservation, education, and access. How do we determine the authenticity and value of art objects and natural specimens? How have museums informed debates over national politics and cultural authority? And how do museum collections create narratives about national and natural history? We will explore these and other questions through a range of sources, including fiction and poetry, visual and material culture, and periodicals and museum guidebooks, as well as visits to Harvard?s own varied museum collections and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum."
HIST-LIT 90DF - Human Rights and Transitional Justice in Latin America,HIST,LIT 90DF ,"Description:  This course will examine the emergence of the twin phenomenon of human rights advocacy and transitional justice across Latin America, exploring the original debates and major players within the movement, a few of the larger case studies in the past three decades throughout the region, and the central issues now facing the field. We will examine how a human rights discourse emerged in these nations, and how the countries dealt in different ways with the repressive legal, cultural, and political legacies of authoritarianism. We will examine how human rights definitions changed and intersected with calls for justice within the emerging the democratic governments, and how accountability claims evolved in the decades following the military rule based on domestic political battles and changing international norms. As a group, we will focus on existing literature on justice and truth-telling in the politics of transition, as well as scholarship on social memory and historical commemorations by using literature, film, testimonies, government documents, and scholarly articles."
HIST-LIT 90DG - Everyday Life in Cold War Berlin,HIST,LIT 90DG ,"Description:  In this course, we will examine the history of Berlin from the ?rubble years? after World War II, through the aftermath of German unification in the 1990s from the perspective of the history of everyday life. Our discussion of diaries, primary source documents, historical studies, literature, films, art, and music produced in divided Berlin will reveal how the divided city shaped individual lives and subjectivities, and how individual Berliners shaped the history of Cold War Berlin."
HIST-LIT 90DH - Students at the Barricades: Student Activism in Global Perspective,HIST,LIT 90DH ,"Description:  What is the role of the student in the struggle for global justice? Do students bear particular responsibility in addressing global inequalities? How does student activism differ from other forms of activism, and how do they intersect? Has student activism changed over time, and have different student movements across the world exhibited different characteristics? What are the economic, cultural and political factors that have animated the emergence of vibrant student movements? And how has this particular form of activism been portrayed and fostered through literature and film? This course will explore the role that students have played and continue to play in social justice movements around our world. Throughout our study of student mobilization across time and geographies, we will debate how these movements should be understood, and the role they play in altering social values, practices and institutions. The purpose of this course is to theorize the ways in which these critical movements come into being and their consequences. This course aims to be directly relevant to your lives as students, and to encourage you to think broadly about the struggle to enact change in our world."
HIST-LIT 90DI - Speculative Fictions in Multiethnic America,HIST,LIT 90DI ,"Description:  Speculative fiction, especially science fiction, is known to be a predominantly white genre; data from one source, the sci-fi trade journal Locus, indicates that less than 5% of SF and fantasy books published are by writers of color. This course examines in an intentionally multi-ethnic framework speculative fiction written by African American, Asian American, and white authors alike in the 20th and 21st centuries, which opens us up to the diversity of themes, concepts, and settings to be found ? should we be interested in looking for it. From the early Afro-futurism of W.E.B Du Bois?s ?The Comet,? to the techno-orientalism of Paolo Bacigalupi?s The Windup Girl, to the environmental critique of Karen Tei Yamashita?s Through the Arc of the Rainforest, contemporary speculative fiction asks us to imagine a world completely alien to us and works to uncover the hidden operations, institutions, and power structures of our own ? often, though not always, at the same time. Yet, some of the authors examined in this course also reveal that their writings are not necessarily dictated or primarily influenced by their identity markers. Ultimately, in this course, we will gain a nuanced appreciation for the breadth of conceptual concerns covered in contemporary speculative fiction. We will also learn to read both with and against the grain of our expectations as readers, and to use this fluidity to reflect on the ethical dimensions of reading and writing."
HIST-LIT 90DK - Asian/American Graphic Novels,HIST,LIT 90DK ,"Description:  The course on Asian American studies focuses on the genre and form of comics and graphic novels in the context of histories of migration and diasporas. Through these illustrative and textual works, we will explore the representation of Asian American identity and the experience of racial difference through possible works, such as Adrian Tomine?s Shortcomings, Mine Okubo?s Citzen 13660, and Thi Bui?s The Best We Could Do. The course will also open up to consider the transnational and global literature of Asian/American graphic novels from other sights of Asian migration and diaspora, including Chinese Australian Shuan Tan?s The Arrival and Japanese British Fumio Obata?s Just So Happens. As such, this course seeks to examine literary works and cultural productions in the form of comics and graphic novels that engage with and articulate the Asian American experience as well as the sense of being Asian in the world."
HIST-LIT 90DL - Global Hollywood,HIST,LIT 90DL ,"Description:  This course charts the development of the American film industry in the context of and in response to the pressures of world capitalism and the shaping forces of geopolitics. ?Global Hollywood? begins with the ?universal language? hypothesis, the belief among theorists and makers of early cinema that the silent movie functioned as a twentieth-century Esperanto; it proceeds to the problem of sound cinema and the shooting of multiple language versions of movies in the early 30s, and then addresses World War II (Three Amigos; Why We Fight), the European influence on what would become known as film noir (Sunset Boulevard), science fiction allegories of the Cold War and nuclear anxiety (Invasion of the Body Snatchers), and so on up to our current regime of international coproduction (Mad Max: Fury Road; Arrival). Along the way, American films will be supplemented by international responses to Hollywood, both in film (e.g. Godard?s Contempt; Fassbinder?s Ali: Fear Eats the Soul) and literature (e.g. Manuel Puig?s Kiss of the Spiderwoman)."
HIST-LIT 90DN - Alternative Archives,HIST,LIT 90DN ,"Description:  What is an archive? Starting from the premise that archives, as records of the past, are themselves products of history, this course will focus on the politics of archives and teach students how to read archival sources against the grain. We will begin by exploring ways of engaging with traditional archives, with particular attention to strategies scholars have used to mine official sources to focus on the people they marginalized. From there, we will turn to contemporary archival practices, including digital databases, private collections, oral histories, digital media, and artifacts such as photographs, sound, performance, and other non-textual evidence. Readings will include canonical theory and scholarship on archives, as well as recent interventions that propose alternative repositories of decolonized knowledge. Over the course of the semester, students will also visit archives on campus and online, culminating in the production of original scholarship that employs archival sources."
HIST-LIT 90DO - Old Weird America,HIST,LIT 90DO ,"Description:  This seminar focuses on the United States before 1865. Poised halfway between our current moment and the seemingly archaic, superstitious fervor of the Salem Witch Trials, America in the antebellum era was in the process of fitfully, at times reluctantly, becoming modern. We will focus on strange objects?photographs of dead children, the spectacles created by P. T. Barnum, the seedy newspapers of antebellum New York?and texts that figure the disorienting changes to media, transportation, personhood, and nation that unfolded as the United States settled uneasily into nationhood. Considering literary and subliterary texts, religious beliefs, visual culture, and political practices with an eye to race, gender, sexuality, and class, students will learn about a period that is in many respects deeply alien to contemporary Americans but offers surprising moments of coincidence with the present."
HIST-LIT 90L - Stories of Slavery and Freedom,HIST,LIT 90L ,"Description:  In the last generation, scholars have revolutionized our understanding of slavery and freedom in the modern Atlantic world. This sea-change has been the result of a major methodological shift: to view this history through the eyes of slaves rather than the eyes of masters. This course will examine the history of the ""black Atlantic"" through a diverse range of cultural texts--poetry, pamphlets, court cases, petitions, autobiographies, novels, speeches, and sermons--produced by slaves, free blacks, and abolitionists from the Age of Revolution to emancipation."

HISTSCI 100 - Knowing the World: An Introduction to the History of Science,HISTSCI 100 , Knowing the World: An Introduction to the History of Science,"Description:  What are the origins of modern science and of the scientific method? Have the ways of knowing the world of different cultures and societies changed over time? How has scientific knowledge been related to other enterprises such as art, religion, literature, and commerce? We will ask these questions and more through a broad survey of many of the crucial moments in the development of science from the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century to the present day. Topics and figures will include Galileo, evolution, eugenics, the atomic bomb, and the human genome project."
HISTSCI 147 - The Changing Concept of Race in America: From Jefferson to Genomics,HISTSCI 147 , The Changing Concept of Race in America: From Jefferson to Genomics,"Description:  This course explores changing concepts of race in American science and medicine, and examines the historical meanings and uses of these concepts in U.S. society from the 18th century to the present. The course asks the following questions: How have diverse scientific and medical disciplines historically defined, measured, and produced knowledge about ?race?? How have scientific and medical concepts of race historically interrelated with key political, economic, and social institutions? How do current 21st century genomic concepts of race fit into this larger history of race and science?"
HISTSCI 147V - Graphic! Visualizing Medicine from Textbooks to Comics,HISTSCI 147V , Graphic! Visualizing Medicine from Textbooks to Comics,"Description:  Visuals play an important role in the history and practice of medicine, from medical textbooks to medical imaging, and from hospital signage and public health posters to comics and graphic novels. This course will examine the use of visuals in medicine, but will place particular emphasis on a new academic and creative field known as ?graphic medicine??medical comics and graphic novels. Over the course of the semester, we will ask questions about how attending to the visual allows us to think in new ways about diagnostic practices, therapeutics, medical consumerism, doctor-patient communication, and ways in which patients and caregivers narrate their personal experiences of disease. We will pay careful attention to questions of class, race and gender, and to larger ethical and political issues raised by our materials."
HISTSCI 181V - Digital Cultures,HISTSCI 181V , Digital Cultures,"Description:  This course examines the history and cultures of digital computing technologies. In the first half of the semester, students will learn to approach computers as artifacts that embed the social orders and cultural practices that produce them. Students explore the history of automation; cybernetics and World War II; the Cold War and the Closed World; artificial intelligence and gendered subjectivity; the growth of the Internet as a military and commercial project. The second half of the course explores how digital computing shapes our contemporary world: topics include big data, surveillance, computer graphics, and video games. Emphasis is placed on how ideas about gender, privacy, and democracy shape labor practices, models of cognition, and material and symbolic practices of networking in an increasingly online world."
HISTSCI 182 - An American Way of War: Technology and Warfare,HISTSCI 182 , An American Way of War: Technology and Warfare,"Description:  American society has, from its founding, been transformed by the experience of warfare. This lecture course explores two interconnected ideas: the development of military technologies from the earliest settlement of North America to the present day, and the profound impact of these technologies on people, including veterans and the societies to which they returned. Beginning with an examination of bladed weapons and the psychology of killing, we will look at how supposedly revolutionary weapon systems?the gun, the tank, the airplane, the atomic bomb, the drone?came to define a distinctly American mode of warfare, and created new problems for those exposed to their lethality."
"HISTSCI 183 - Engineering East Asia: Technology, Society, and the State",HISTSCI 183 ," Engineering East Asia: Technology, Society, and the State","Description:  Who creates and controls technology within society? How have technological developments shaped and, in turn, been shaped by social change? Do technological artifacts have particular politics? In this course, we will explore these and other questions concerning the intertwined relationship of technology, society, and the state within the context of East Asia?s long twentieth century. From the era of steam power to the present, East Asia has undergone epochal social and technological transformations. China?s recent bold forays into artificial intelligence are but among the latest in broader trends, beginning with Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese successes with consumer electronics manufacturing over preceding decades, that have marked the region as the site from which we may very well see the emergence of our technological future. In examining the history of technology in modern East Asia, we will gain a deeper understanding of the region and its technological revolutions and, more generally, of the workings of technology in the industrial modern age."
"HISTSCI 192 - The Empire Strikes Back: Science Fiction, Religion, and Society",HISTSCI 192 ," The Empire Strikes Back: Science Fiction, Religion, and Society","Description:  From the seventeenth century to today, science fiction has reflected the aspirations of scientific innovation and anticipated new discoveries. It has reflected rhetorical practices by which science melds present contexts with futurism, extrapolation, and promissory logics. Authors have engaged with ethical problems, fears about innovations gone awry, and pessimism about the prospects of technological development, all while critiquing views on gender, race, and sexuality, and subverting colonial ambitions while engaging postcolonial aspirations. At the same time, science fiction has engaged religious and spiritual views, both interacting with religious imaginaries and engaging with the role of religion in society and in relation to science. In this course, we trace science fiction through history. We analyze how it has understood science and technology, war and colonialism, sex, race and gender, health and disease. We investigate how it has interacted with religion and influenced social and cultural attitudes. We will read major works in science fiction and understand how they live with and within us. Topics include: time travel, utopias and dystopias, race, gender, and sexuality, religion and culture, embodiment and disembodiment, posthumanism). In addition to novels and short stories, lectures will incorporate film, television, graphic novels, music videos, and other science fictional subgenres. The course will be accompanied by a film series of major science fiction films and guest speakers (film series attendance is optional)."
"HISTSCI 209 - Science and Religion: Debates, Approaches and Controversies",HISTSCI 209 ," Science and Religion: Debates, Approaches and Controversies","Description:  How is your cellphone part of religious experience? Why do some people refuse to vaccinate their children? And why do some reject evolution and global warming? What is missionary medicine and how is it related to global health? What role do religious institutions play in our lives? And why does research show that prayers can improve health outcomes? How important is Pope Francis?s encyclical on the environment? And why should we care?!The study of science and religion has been dominated by a limited set of views that range from animosity to attempts at reconciliation. Yet, these approaches remain largely normative and are deeply rooted in particular readings of European history. In this course, we move beyond debates of conflict or harmony into deeper discussions of how scientific and religious discourses impact daily lives and how issues of race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status impact these discourses. The course is a research lab where students are trained on research methods, and on different genres of scholarly writing, including grants. Students choose two modules out of four addressing religion and (1) medicine and global health, (2) environmental and natural sciences, (3) social sciences, and (4) art. In each module, students learn about major questions in the field, work with different methods, and produce innovative research projects."

HISTSCI 249 - The Opioid Epidemic in Historical Perspective,HISTSCI 249 , The Opioid Epidemic in Historical Perspective,"Description:  This course will trace the use of opiates and other addictive substances over the last century. The goal will be to understand the historical and social contexts of the emergence and significance of the current epidemic, as well as public policies designed to address its impact. The course will also explore the social, cultural, medical, and political determinants of the rise in opioid addiction and its associated morbidity and mortality. Students will be required to write an original research paper that will be part of a multi-authored anthology on the history of the epidemic."
HISTSCI 266V - Science and Globalization,HISTSCI 266V , Science and Globalization,"Description:  About fifty years ago, George Basalla, a recent Harvard PhD graduate, published ?The Spread of Western Science,? describing stages in the diffusion of science around the world. What have we learned since then? Historians of science are now deftly showing how science is ?situated? and fragmentary?but are we any more adroit at explaining how science travels and comes to appear unitary? This seminar surveys approaches to the spread of science?in the circumstances, often a somewhat enigmatic category?looking at diffusionist and circulatory models, actor-network theories, imperial and subaltern histories, area and borderlands studies, problems of exchange and transaction, issues of connection and translation. Drawing on anthropological insights, we will examine the applicability of frames such as contact zones and trading zones. Particular attention will be given to Indigenous and settler colonial perspectives. We will ask what postcolonial or decolonial science studies might become."
HISTSCI 281 - Science and Technology in East Asia,HISTSCI 281 , Science and Technology in East Asia,"Description:  This graduate proseminar surveys developments in the field of science and technology in East Asia from the early modern period to the recent past. Through the critical reading of scholarship both classic and contemporary, we will familiarize ourselves with the main historiographical debates that have shaped the field, and think through the processes and politics involved in writing this history. We will also discuss ways that these debates can be brought into the classroom for undergraduate teaching. Topics we will cover include the Needham question, everyday technologies, natural history and systems of classification, scientific nationalism, and technoscience under communism and capitalism. Background knowledge in East Asian history expected and required."
"HISTSCI 285 - Science, Power and Politics",HISTSCI 285 ," Science, Power and Politics",Description:  This seminar introduces students to the major contributions of the field of science and technology studies (STS) to the understanding of politics and policymaking in democratic societies.
"HISTSCI 299 - Science, State, Corporation",HISTSCI 299 ," Science, State, Corporation","Description:  In the heat of World War II, the state for the first time systematically contracted universities to advance science and technology to pursue the war effort. During the Cold War, the institutional and legal arrangements that facilitated the state-science relationship broadened to cover a vast range of disciplines and agencies, from the far reaches of theoretical physics to the most applied technologies. This course will explore the major, ongoing post-Cold War shift in this arrangement: corporations and foundations now play a powerful role in directing and supporting scientific inquiry. The seminar asks: How are the relations among state, science, for-profit corporations, and civil society changing? How do contemporary politics interplay with research funding from all sources? What is the new geography of technical-scientific work? What kind of work, what forms of knowledge are stressed or dropped? Who is engaged in its pursuit and how is it disseminated? How do law and (de-)regulation affect the newly emergent model, and how are they affected by it?"

A schizophrenic man paralyzed by fear and hallucinations is freed from a mental institution by clozapine. A meth addict lies, cheats, and steals, enduing up emaciated and dead. Miracles and monstrosities, all related to a single molecule - dopamine. The overall goal of this tutorial is to focus on a single subject, a single chemical neurotransmitter, and remaining on that topic to proceed through three phases of study, as follows. First, to orient students to tools from multiple traditional disciplines: synaptic mechanisms of neurotransmission, neuropharmacology, behavioral pharmacology, neuroanatomy, and psychiatry. Second, to elicit interest and curiosity through examples of specific and important disease states: Parkinson's Disease, Schizophrenia, and Drug Addiction. Third, to gain an historical perspective up to and including a current and sophisticated consensus (i.e., review articles of recent years). Socratic debate will be prioritized in the classroom. The main discipline presented in this course is pharmacology, specifically, in vivo pharmacology and more specifically, behavioral pharmacology in humans. Pharmacology has traditionally been a graduate-level subject and rarely present in undergraduate curricula. That is a shame, because pharmacology has played and continues to play a key role in the history of neuroscience, in many applications of clinical medicine, and in the relationships among ""mind, brain, and behavior."" Moreover, students with an interest in medical sciences and careers will find extremely useful the tools and concepts of pharmacology, from elucidating mechanisms of action using basic research, to applications in the clinic using analgesic, antipsychotic, anti-Parkinsonian, stimulant, and anesthetic drugs. My philosophy of teaching is that 70% of the work can be completed in the classroom. I believe the rest can be completed in 1-2 hours per week outside of the classroom. Mostly to study your notes from class together with an outline prepared and distributed by Dr. Caine, and then to complete the semi-weekly writing assignment (""take-home"" quizzes, open book, open note, short answer, six assignments in all)."
MBB 980N - Neuroaesthetics,MBB 980N , Neuroaesthetics,"Description:  Focuses on neuroaesthetics, an emerging field offering a scientific perspective on the nature of art and the ways that art reveals human nature. Integrates findings from neuroscience, psychology, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and scholarship in the arts and humanities. Beings with a brief history of ideas on aesthetics, art, beauty, and pleasure. Considers the neural underpinnings of response to art in the brain's reward system and default network. Among the questions considered: Why are people drawn to art that is neither conventionally beautiful nor entirely pleasurable? Is art a vehicle for simulating experiences and understanding other minds? What does it mean to ""enjoy"" sad music or chills and thrills in response to fiction or film? Can art promote well-being? The course will range across the arts but will focus on fiction, film, and music, and response to art rather than its creation."
MBB 980P - The Role of Music in Health and Education,MBB 980P , The Role of Music in Health and Education,"Description:  Music shapes the course of human history at both a micro and macro scale; it can make an individual weep and rally crowds of thousands to cheer. The ""universal language"" has the power to connect people who share no other common ground. Its power to bind people together is intuitively understood, but only through recent neuroimaging advances over the past 50 years have scientists been able to move past intuition to reveal its impact on the brain. Through this course, we will examine the exciting progress of the fields of music and medicine, through a variety of lenses. Who are the key investigators and practitioners in today's emerging music / brain landscape? What are the latest discoveries about how music influences the brain? How does the direct application of music function ? how do we hear, how do we listen, and what happens when this process goes wrong? What has music's role been through human history, and where does that bring us today? This course invites the student to deepen his/her relationship with music exploring different aspects of the art form through several perspectives, including neuroscientist, educator, musician, therapist, patient, and healthcare provider. By the end of this course, the learner will (1) understand the effect of music on the developing brain; (2) understand the mechanism of hearing music; (3) consider the pathophysiology of disordered movement and hearing and how music can be used therapeutically; and (4) understand how other disciplines can add educational and neuroscientific knowledge to therapeutic uses of music. Students will be invited to bring their own experiences to the seminar, and to pursue a final independent project, conducting a combination of scientific, historical, education, or psychology research. In the final weeks, they will present their findings to the group in oral, written or musical format. Given the transdisciplinary nature of the work, students will be challenged to read literature from a variety of genres, from lay literature to educational monographs to scientific papers. This will lead to discussion of one of the key questions in interdisciplinary study between the sciences and the arts: how to research and document outcomes. How do we agree on common definitions of research in disparate fields? What constitutes research to a musician? A music therapist? A neuroscientist? A physician? What is proof of success? What can/should be measured?"

MUSIC 209R - Ethnomusicology: Seminar,MUSIC 209R , Ethnomusicology: Seminar,"Description:  Music and the Anthropology of Ethics and Morality. The seminar explores the literature on moral anthropology in conjunction with ethnomusicological case studies from Mali, Indonesia, Trinidad, and indigenous Canada. In the last ten years a burgeoning anthropology of ethics and morality has addressed in new ways longstanding issues of cultural relativism, diversity, resistance, and personhood. Building on Durkheim and Foucault, authors such as Zigon, Fassin, Laidlaw, Ortner, and others have drawn attention to the pluralist quality of moral diversity, the relationship of ethics and freedom, and the lived experience of morality and ethics in an ontological sense. At the same time scholars such as Weintraub, Rommen, Dueck, Diamond, Skinner, Shelemay, and Perman have raised ethical issues in ethnomusicology. The seminar convenes a conversation to synthesize and extend the insights of this literature."
MUSIC 217R - 19th- and 20th-Century Music,MUSIC 217R , 19th,"Description:  Aurality, Listening, and Hearing: Histories. This seminar will put critical pressure on the methods by which Sound Studies. as well as the Music-and-Science mainstream, construct histories of humans and sound, considering two fundamental questions: (a) whether it is possible (or not) to recover the listening or hearing of past historical subjects; and (b) what it means to use sound (or music) as an ?epistemic tool.? We will discuss the proper domains and/or limits of keyword flashpoints like ?auditory knowledge,? ?listening practices,? and ?epistemes of acoustics.? Making a distinction between aurality and listening on the one hand, and hearing on the other, means delving into the science of physiological hearing, and to that end there will be guest seminars led by faculty from the Harvard Medical School. We will be considering the ideology of deafness, as well as early (nineteenth-century) investigations of aural acuity. Mara Mills (NYU, History of Science, and Disability Studies) will be a guest seminar leader for this section; we will be reading (in advance of the book publication) selected work group papers from the October 2016 conference at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, Testing Hearing. We will also examine assertions that Golden-Age sound technologies such as the phonograph ushered in culturally widespread paradigm changes in listening practices, as part of a general consideration of the feedback loops between technological artifacts and human experience."
MUSIC 218RS - 20th-Century Music: Seminar,MUSIC 218RS , 20th,"Description:  Groove. This seminar explores the phenomenon of groove, both as a topic of musicological discourse and an element within various musical practices. Common as the notion may be, groove resists simple definition. In certain contexts, ?groove? may refer to relatively large-scale recursive structures (to which James Brown?s ?Play the groove!? makes reference). In other contexts, ?groove? refers to the effect engendered by minute variations between sonic elements (summoned when performing musicians talk about ?being in the groove?). What, then, is the relationship between these two conceptions of groove? What tensions arise from the term?s multiple meanings? And how might the notion of groove be generalized beyond the contexts of popular music? This course seeks to examine these and other questions, in part, by showing how the syntactical and the sensory, the formal and the phenomenological dimensions of groove work together to animate various musical genres."

We will survey rock `n? roll?s early 20th century roots, the rock `n? roll explosion of the 1950s, surf-rock, folk-rock, blues-rock, the British Invasion, and psychedelic rock through the early 1970s. As we discuss the evolution of ?rock `n? roll? of the 1950s to ?rock? of the 1960s and 70s, we will consider the role of songs, albums, and artists, as well as producers, promoters, fans, and detractors."

In this writing-intensive course we will listen to music together, refine our attention to its ingredients and its construction, share and unpack our listening strategies, develop and strengthen our vocabularies to describe what we hear, and cultivate a critical perspective on the act of listening. Since our focus is on process, our repertoire will be wide-ranging and partly selected by the class. Students will collectively edit and self-publish a monthly anthology of their writings."

Sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby investigators in human and animal research work together to continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Scientific findings increasingly point to the importance of sleep for mental health and optimum performance, as well as to sleep disruption as both a result and potential cause of mental illness. In psychiatric neuroscience, sleep is an area in which many fundamental questions remain unanswered due to the unique challenges of studying human sleep.Students must complete both terms of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit."

Some of you, upon encountering in the previous sentence words like ""programming"" and ""numerical simulations,"" will feel the cold hand of fear grip your stomach, because you have never done any programming and, in fact, have tried to avoid math as much as possible. If so, YOU ARE PRECISELY THE PERSON WE HAD IN MIND as we were planning the course. We are aiming to help you break through this barrier of darkness and fear into the radiant sunshine of quantitative enlightenment. The true beauty of MATLAB, as we will personally demonstrate, is that it allows people who are not mathematically adept (e.g. some of the instructors of this course) to use powerful numerical methods and visualization tools to gain an understanding of concepts that are very difficult to grasp analytically."

The course will cover foundational statistical methods including linear and logistic regression, generalized linear models, survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and multilevel modeling. Discussion will be given to important concepts including study design, sampling, scientific inference, causal reasoning, measurement, and replication. The course will also provide an overview of a number of additional and sometimes more advanced methods including Bayesian statistics, big data methods, missing data, sensitivity analysis, propensity scores, time-varying exposures, interaction, mediation, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, difference-in-difference methods, selection models, time series, bootstrapping, simulations, and meta-analysis. With these latter topics, emphasis will be placed on understanding the basic definitions, assumptions, and methodology. Students will be referred to further readings and courses to gain more detailed understanding. Various software resources will be used throughout the course. The course will prepare students to critically read through the empirical population health science literature, and to implement a number of different methods in their own research.

Scholars across several disciplines have sought to explain why income inequality is ubiquitous and persistent. In this course, we are particularly concerned with how features of the mind, and the mind in society, help explain the widening gap between the rich and the poor. How do people perceive income inequality, and how do those perceptions influence their social attitudes and policy positions? Why do people who stand to benefit from redistribution sometimes oppose it? How do we decide what?s fair, and when do perceptions of fairness emerge in human development? How does perceived lack of control or power affect the psychology of low-status groups, and how do those effects, in turn, influence power imbalances? In answering these questions, we?ll consider a diversity of perspectives from the literatures on evolutionary and developmental psychology, social psychology, political science and social policy."

This class covers basic and advanced topics of Bayesian statistics in a very applied way with a strong focus on applications in Psychology (and Social Sciences in general). Formulas and technical details are kept on a minimum -- it is all about how to integrate Bayesian concepts into your everyday research.The first part of the course introduces students to the Bayesian paradigm of inferential statistics (as opposed to the frequentist approach everyone is familiar with). We elaborate on Bayes' seminal theorem and introduce gently the core components of Bayesian inference: prior distributions, posterior distributions, and Bayes factors. Subsequently, we will learn about simulation based approaches for sampling posterior distributions. These are the infamous MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) techniques and have fancy names such as Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling.Then we are ready to actually do Bayesian inference and testing. We start with simple statistical tests and models such as t-test, ANOVA, and regression and compute them in a Bayesian way. We extend our modeling approach to generalized linear models (GLM) and a model family where Bayesian statistics turnsout to be super helpful: hierarchical (aka multilevel or mixed-effects) models. Finally, we focus on modern, more specific (psychometric) Bayesian methods such as multidimensional/multilevel item response theory (IRT), Bayesian latent variable models, latent Dirichlet allocations (LDA; as e.g. used in natural language processing), and Bayesian networks.All topics covered will be supported by corresponding computations and illustrations in R.

This course combines theories and frameworks from social psychology and behavioral economics to understand the complex process of decision-making. We will consider how social and situational influences such as emotions, social motivations, group dynamics, psychological distance, framing and cultural orientation impact perceptions of risk. We will also explore the growing research on nudges -- subtle but powerful changes in the environment that can counteract behavioral biases and encourage better decisions.

We will examine classic personality theorists and their paradigm-shifting models of personality that changed accepted thinking on healthy personality development and led to very different treatment methods for disorders like anxiety and depression. We will discuss major debates and research findings in contemporary personality psychology, including the latest research on topics such as unconscious motivation, self-efficacy, locus of control, defensive pessimism, fear of success, self-actualization, and trait theories of introversion and extraversion.

PSY 980JS - But Why?: Ultimate Explanations for the Quirks of the Mind,PSY 980JS , But Why?: Ultimate Explanations for the Quirks of the Mind,"Description:  Social psychology has documented many surprising features of the human mind, providing robust evidence that people deceive themselves, are systematically overconfident, believe implausible things to avoid inconsistency, and so on. Explanations often focus on proximate psychological mechanisms (e.g., we avoid inconsistency because we find it uncomfortable). But behind every proximate mechanism is an ultimate explanation (why is inconsistency uncomfortable?)?why did evolution or learning lead us to be this way? This course will examine proximate and ultimate explanations for classic social psychological phenomena and the insight that ultimate level explanations add, with a focus on how to test ultimate explanations convincingly"

This course reads some exercises in ethical persuasion from Christianity's philosophical competitors: Plato, Aristotle, Epictetus, the Cynics. It juxtaposes these with early and medieval Chirstian authors that want to surpass the philosophers in persuasive power: Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, the desert ascetics, Alan of Lille, Bonaventure, Thomas Aquina, Marguerite Porete."

In the 1970s, James Cone?s Black Theology took its point of departure, in part, from Cone?s critique of Barth. This course will closely read each author, looking at similarities and differences in how they approach theological topics (e.g., God, human being, scripture, nature, salvation, church). Throughout, we will consider what these four projects can teach us both about the ?tradition? of Reformed theology and the task and responsibility of theology more generally."

Since these genres represent examples of language, symbols and styles of worship shared across Islamic and non-Islamic denominational boundaries, we will also examine their relationships with other Indic traditions of devotion, particularly those associated with the so-called sant and Hindu bhakti movements. Special emphasis will be given to the impact of contemporary political ideologies, globalization and the revolution in media technology on the form and function of these genres and their relationship with contemporary communities of faith in South Asia and beyond."

Rather than merely reciting grim statistics and body counts, we will illustrate the effects of these diseases as seen through the lens of history, literature, film, music and drama. We will celebrate how these infections have stimulated revolutionary epidemiologic and scientific advances in detection, treatment, and prevention, but we will also explore the darker side of this story. Behind the veneer of inexorable progress lies the reality that infections have spawned stigmatization, prejudice, exclusion, shameful human experimentation, social injustice, and inequalities in health outcomes. Even today, if we look behind the curtain of miracle drugs and a flourishing medical-industrial complex, we find that these same troubling themes remain relevant across the globe, and in the US.By weaving science together with the humanities, students will learn to address current and emerging global infectious disease threats and the social justice challenges they pose. We will provide enough clinical and scientific background about each infection for students to fully understand why they have had such important societal effects. Classes and sections will be highly interactive, including case studies, games, advocacy ?pitches,? a mock trial, debates, role playing, and collaborative learning."

Has it always been in crisis?Until recently, liberal democracy was largely taken for granted in the West, and many saw it as the wave of the future around the globe. But over the last decade, it has come under challenge in unanticipated ways. Far-right parties gained ground in many countries, although recent elections in Europe suggest that they have plateaued and might even be in retreat. Donald Trump?s election brought this conversation directly to American shores. This class will discuss the challenge to liberal democracy, with special reference to the United States, but also in comparative perspective. There will be particular attention to France, Britain, the Netherlands and Germany and also discussion of the similarities and differences between our time and the 1930s.

SOCIOL 1134 - Sociology of Religion,SOCIOL 1134 , Sociology of Religion,"Description:  At the core of the reflection on modernity, religion was an important aspect of social theory. In Europe the philosophy of Enlightenment, associated to the process of secularization at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, settled religion as an important aspect of social theory mainly in the oeuvre of Emile Durkheim and Max Weber. The question has become how to combine individuals and collective beliefs with the expectations of modernity, what place to religion in the recomposition of societies. The rise of religious fundamentalisms and or the increasing importance of religion in public lives today raise the question of the relevance of modernity that inspired the sociology of the beginning of century, and the place of religious phenomenon in the sociology of religion today. This course will explore the different understanding of state-religion relationship in different societies, the meaning of religious claims in contexts, its visibility on the local, national and transnational level, as well as its organization that leads to the sociology of religion associated with globalization."
SOCIOL 1148 - Race and Ethnicity in Global and Comparative Perspective,SOCIOL 1148 , Race and Ethnicity in Global and Comparative Perspective,"Description:  This course provides an introduction to the comparative study of ?race and ethnicity? around the world. We focus here not on particular ?ethnic? or ?racial? groups, but rather, on particular cases which illustrate how ?race? is used as a way in which to divide, sort, and rank human beings (i.e. a principle of social vision and division). In particular, we compare and contrast how different societies have constructed ethnoracial boundaries by focusing on several key forms of ethnoracial domination: categorization, discrimination, segregation, ghettoization, and exclusionary violence. Readings include sociological, historical, and anthropological studies of ethnoracial dynamics primarily in the U.S. and Brazil, but also South Africa, Asia, Western Europe, and Latin America."

SOCIOL 1172 - Complex Organizations,SOCIOL 1172 , Complex Organizations,"Description:  Organizations are central to our lives: most of us are born in hospitals, educated in schools, and employed in firms, non-profits, and governmental agencies. All these organizations attempt to encourage some behaviors and attitudes, such as love of learning or hard work, and discourage others, such as sexual harrassment or free-riding. This course asks, when do organizations succeed in these attempts and when do they fail? We will investigate how culture, institutions, incentives, and individual agency interact in organizations to shape behavior, and how these forces intersect to produce desirable or undesirable outcomes for organizations and their members. As a capstone project, students will apply what they have learned to propose a new solution to an organizational problem of their choice."

SOCIOL 1186 - Refugees in Global Perspective,SOCIOL 1186 , Refugees in Global Perspective,"Description:  The recent influx of Middle Eastern refugees into Europe has caught citizens and policy-makers off guard. Yet such waves will continue to rock our globalized world in coming decades: massive movements of forced migrants will be ?the new normal.? Why is the world producing so many refugees? How are they displaced? Where do they travel, and why? This course will inquire into the nature, causes and consequences of contemporary refugee waves in our globalized world. Students will survey regional dynamics in the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and North America. We will examine the particularities of refugees (compared to other migrants) and the changing nature of forced migration since the Second World War. Students will explore historical precedents to contemporary waves, learn about different host society approaches to asylum, compare government and criminal mechanisms of forced migration, and examine the reasons refugees are the object of increasing suspicion and hostility around the world. Particular attention will be paid to the recent EU crisis, the role of refugee camps in the 21st century, and alternative strategies for global asylum management by bridge and destination countries."

WOMGEN 1281 - Hysterical Women: A History,WOMGEN 1281 , Hysterical Women: A History,"Description:  What does it mean when contemporary media sources characterize celebrity figures, or frenzied consumers, as 'hysterical?? How are ""hysteria"" and ""insanity"" related, and what are the historical roots of these loaded concepts? This seminar addresses the complex history of hysteria by asking how this medicalized affliction has assumed a multiplicity of forms, especially on feminized and non-white bodies. As depicted through newspapers, multimedia sources, medical literature, sociological articles, and psychoanalytic texts, 'hysteria' affords a unique lens onto the social, cultural and medical history of mental and physical suffering. In a postcolonial world, the term has taken on even more complexity. As we compose a 'history of hysteria,' we will reflect on who gets to record history and whose narratives get left out."
WOMGEN 1283 - Love's Labors Found: Uncovering Histories of Emotional Labor,WOMGEN 1283 , Love's Labors Found: Uncovering Histories of Emotional Labor,"Description:  How do love, care, and desire influence the value of work, and why is emotional labor ? which is vital to child or elder care, domestic labor,nursing, teaching, and sex work ? often considered to be something other than work? How and why do the racial and gender identities ofworkers affect the economic, social, and emotional value of their labor? How do political and social arrangements of labor help produce and reinforce racial categories while solidifying the boundaries separating masculinity and femininity? Through a mix of primary and secondary sources, this seminar explores histories of emotional labor and the power structures that give meaning to often taken-for-granted categories of work. These sometimes hidden histories are key to untangling the gender, sexual, and racial implications of the ?intimate industries? that populate today?s transnational labor economies."

This course will begin with some contemporary manifestations of these issues, here in the US, in Europe, and in the Middle East and North Africa. It will then move back into history of the present, in order to trace some of these meanings, in their emergence at different moments, and consider their distinct political work in various historical contexts.

WOMGEN 1281 - Hysterical Women: A History,WOMGEN 1281 , Hysterical Women: A History,"Description:  What does it mean when contemporary media sources characterize celebrity figures, or frenzied consumers, as 'hysterical?? How are ""hysteria"" and ""insanity"" related, and what are the historical roots of these loaded concepts? This seminar addresses the complex history of hysteria by asking how this medicalized affliction has assumed a multiplicity of forms, especially on feminized and non-white bodies. As depicted through newspapers, multimedia sources, medical literature, sociological articles, and psychoanalytic texts, 'hysteria' affords a unique lens onto the social, cultural and medical history of mental and physical suffering. In a postcolonial world, the term has taken on even more complexity. As we compose a 'history of hysteria,' we will reflect on who gets to record history and whose narratives get left out."
WOMGEN 1283 - Love's Labors Found: Uncovering Histories of Emotional Labor,WOMGEN 1283 , Love's Labors Found: Uncovering Histories of Emotional Labor,"Description:  How do love, care, and desire influence the value of work, and why is emotional labor ? which is vital to child or elder care, domestic labor,nursing, teaching, and sex work ? often considered to be something other than work? How and why do the racial and gender identities ofworkers affect the economic, social, and emotional value of their labor? How do political and social arrangements of labor help produce and reinforce racial categories while solidifying the boundaries separating masculinity and femininity? Through a mix of primary and secondary sources, this seminar explores histories of emotional labor and the power structures that give meaning to often taken-for-granted categories of work. These sometimes hidden histories are key to untangling the gender, sexual, and racial implications of the ?intimate industries? that populate today?s transnational labor economies."

This course will begin with some contemporary manifestations of these issues, here in the US, in Europe, and in the Middle East and North Africa.
